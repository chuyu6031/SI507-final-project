Take time to understand the full breadth of contextual information available to you and you\u2019re far more likely to find opportunities to support the shoppers\u2019 need at a particular moment in time.", "Earn Their Trust": "Earning trust is difficult. It\u2019s a long-term relationship nurtured by persistent and consistent good experiences. Lose a customers' trust in pervasive, beacon-powered applications, and they will be afraid to walk in (or near) your store. You thought building trust in eCommerce was tough, you haven't seen anything yet.", "Give them what the real world can't": "Provide personalized tools and features that reduce the amount of thought and effort it takes to budget, plan and shop. Adapt interfaces to fit mental models of physical shopping -- borrow from what we have learned from eCommerce but execute specifically to support in-store, customer centric experiences.", "Reduce complexity of the physical environment": "Pervasive applications should simplify complex environments, much like subway maps simplify the view of a city. Complexity  increases frustration, which diminishes the perceived value and loyalty to the brand. Brands benefit by helping shoppers focus on what's important to the shopper.", "Let them focus on the real-world": "Don't unnecessarily distract shoppers from natural interactions with the environment. Shoppers' primary focus is on their physical surroundings - work in the background and be there when they need you most. Design for contextually relevant attention through visual, auditory and haptic feedback.", "Emulate & augment the direct product experience": "Create a robust sensory experience with virtual products to allow self-guided exploration  of the elements of the product that the shopper needs to  make confident purchases.", "Keep the shopper moving": "Minimize  distractions inherent to the environment and keep them moving to allow them to find essential products quickly. When we keep them moving towards their goal, we free their time to explore.", "Put the shoppers in control": "Accept the fact that pervasive applications can't be accurate 100% of the time. Allow shoppers to step in, turn off auto-pilot, and take control for themselves. ", "Design for hyper-relevant experiences": "As our knowledge of our individual customers matures, we have the opportunity to shape hyper-relevant, deeply personal experiences -- ones that demonstrate that we \u201cget them\u201d and will give them what they need. We must provide value greater than the  perceived risk of giving up information about themselves.", "Be fun, smart, attentive and efficient": "Design truly unique, useful and rewarding experiences.

Any element that isn\u2019t helping the user achieve their goal is working against them because they must process it and store it in working memory, alongside the things that will help them. Avoiding excessive colors, imagery, design flourishes, or layouts that don\u2019t add value is crucial. But simplicity comes with a caveat: don\u2019t overvalue it at the cost of clarity.", "Leverage common design patterns": "By leveraging common design patterns when it makes sense, you are giving the user familiar elements which they already understand. This in turn reduces the amount of learning they need to do, thus enabling them to move right along and get closer to achieving their goal. ", "Eliminate unnescessary tasks": "Anywhere you are asking the user to read content, remember information or make a decision contributes to cognitive load. Whenever possible, it is good to shift these tasks away from the user and make it easier for them to stay focused on their goal. While it isn\u2019t possible to remove all tasks, there is usually an opportunity to offload some task by setting defaults that can be edited, or leveraging previously entered information. Some companies are even taking this a step further with anticipatory design.", "Minimize choices": "As previously mentioned, our working memory is limited. When confronted with too many choices, cognitive load will increase due to decision paralysis. It is important that we minimize the choices the user must make at any given moment, especially in places such as navigation, forms, and drop-downs.", "Display choices as a group": "When choices are split into separate groups and hidden, users often mistake the options that are visible as the complete group. This means that users are likely to never find the additional choices, which not only limits what is available to them, but also makes it more difficult to decide on which option to select because they are not aware of the alternatives. Therefore, it is best to eliminate the resulting cognitive load by always displaying choices as a group.", "Strive for readability": "Making our content legible isn\u2019t enough \u2014 we need to make it readable. This means our typography must be aesthetically pleasing, appropriate for the content and easy to read while design remains relatively invisible. By doing this, we can ensure there are as little distractions as possible for the user, which results in a better understanding of the content by the user.", "Use iconography with caution": "Research has shown that iconography can be hard to memorize and, contrary to intuition, can increase cognitive load by requiring mental processing to infer meaning or recognize. While universally understood icons work well (ie. print, close, play/pause, reply, tweet, share on Facebook), most are subject to the user\u2019s understanding based on previous experience (in which there is no standard). When leveraging the power of iconography, it is best to accompany them with text labels to communicate the meaning and reduce ambiguity."}}, {"heading": "Design Axioms", "link": "/collections/design-axioms", "author": "Juhan Sonin", "sourcetext": "Design Axioms", "sourceurl": "http://designaxioms.com/", "detail": {"Let data scream": "People want data: pictures, graphics, drawings, visualizations, words, numbers, and sounds\u2014they are all data.

Data is the story in applications, so making it as rich as possible as early as possible will radiate through the entire design, elevating your product's quality.", "If Everything is Important Nothing is Important": "Trying to make every single thing attention-grabbing is a classic design mistake.What you consider most important should - certainly, clearly, undeniably - be the single most important aspect of your design.", "Real data is truth": "Shortcuts make design more efficient. Sometimes, they also make it worse.Injecting Lorem Ipsum and other dummy data into design during the creation process sucks. Dummy data leads to dummy design.As a designer, you must get your mitts on real data early in the creation cycle. Data will alter your design brain.Great design surfaces Truth, and real data is Truth.", "Prototype like crazy": "It is impossible to evaluate design ideas properly without a prototype that approximately conveys the final functional form factor.For industrial designers, that means creating objects with the correct form factor using materials as close as possible to the final envisioned product.In software, that means creating with code. Code early, code often, and test and evaluate through a working prototype. There is no better way.", "Design is not a theoretical exercise": "Too often, software designers get mired in unrealistic representations such as wireframes, paper prototypes, and even pixel-perfect screen prints. Software is a kinetic, interactive medium, and the only way to design for it properly is to go from theoretical design artifacts to real, working prototypes as quickly as possible", "Gantt charts are the illusion of management": "Project management is not about documents and process that appear orderly and require attention. Project management is about focusing on the product.Communications, communications,  and communications make  the best project management.Talk about the prototype. Critique the prototype. Use the prototype. Have others bang on the prototype. Sleep with the prototype.", "Prototypes aren't the end; they're the means": "The first generation of digital designers got comfortable with their paper prototypes and static mock-ups. Code meant production; prototype meant we're almost done.The reality is, prototypes are where it starts. You can't evaluate, much less test, software properly until it is behaving in the same environment and context as it will eventually live in.Industrial designers get this. Graphic designers get this. So should you.", "What Interface?": "The best interface is not just beautiful. It is not only elegant and usable and innovative. The best interface is invisible.The ultimate interface is integrated, or subsumed, or invisible. It is designed away. The user interface is a direct path between the users and what they want to do with your product. That should be your goal.Build as minimal an interface as possible to suit your users. Put the beauty, usefulness, and usability into the actual data experience.", "Let the ink, UI, and lines disappear": "Most of the time in interface design, less is more. Achieving it can be a very Zen-like process.Clear your mind of your vision for the user interface. Close your eyes. Re-imagine solving the problems required by the interface as if you were constrained to having no UI at all.Be one with the interface.", "Reduce the distance between users and content": "The primary expectation most users must have for their digital experiences is getting at the content.That is why they\u00b4ve come, and it is why they stay. It is far too easy to put clutter like movies, ads, and candy between the users and the content they thirst for.All of those things have a time and a place, but, when in doubt, always minimize the time to act - clicks, screens, windows, steps, and other interface mechanics - to reduce the distance between users and content.", "Forget the pretty pictures, help people do what they want": "Great design should be appropriately beautiful. Yet, too often, designers let their fascination with beauty undermine great design.Ultimately design is about creating something for use. Beauty is part of the equation, but usability and usefulness are even more important.", "Know thy Code": "An industrial designer who isn't deeply knowledgeable about metals and polymers is currently unemployed.To be a great designer, you must have intimate knowledge of your construction materials. If you want to design software interfaces, you've gotta know a lot about code.", "You should be as familiar with code as design": "Design skills and tools are important. After all, you can't design well without them.However, you also can't design well without understanding how and what you make will be manifested. In interface design, that means code.You may not like to code; you may not want to code. But if you don't invest the time to educate yourself in code to a similar degree as you were educated in design, you will not realize your potential. ", "Make Things": "It really is just that simple: if you are a designer, you need to always be making things. As soon as the idea fits into your head, the pencil or marker or stylus should be in your hand.Designers make. Makers ship. Shippers change the world. Always, always be making.Buy more clay.\nUse more foam board.\nBreak more Lego.", "Don't design it if you don't know how it's going to be built": "For many designers, the details, nooks, and crannies of truly taking a design to \"done\" are the hardest part of the process. Great design requires the focus, commitment, and attention to detail inherent in any craft. That means sticking with your design through every agonizing moment, ensuring the design integrity of your vision lives on in the product."}}, {"heading": " The 12 Realistic Principles of Agile UX", "link": "/collections/the-12-realistic-principles-of-agile-ux", "author": "Guiseppe Getto", "sourcetext": "Studio by UXPin", "sourceurl": "https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/the-12-realistic-principles-of-agile-ux", "detail": {"Customer experience (CX)": "We don\u2019t just want customers to be \u201csatisfied.\u201d We want to design user experiences that are cognizant of both business realities and customer contexts. Customers are not always users, but most customers are going to use one or more points of contact for a given organization.", "Harnessing technological and social change": "We need to define changes that we expect in the next iteration of a project, rather than just adapting to current changes. Instead of putting out fires, our job as UX professionals should be to create future-ready designs that help clients adapt to new challenges. ", "Development timelines that make good use of resources": "Fast is a relative term. For some organizations, getting everyone in the same room once a month can be a huge improvement. Here\u2019s where Lean is important: we should always strive as UX professionals to make efficient use of resources without short-changing our clients by focusing on process improvement, not on process perfection.", "Adaptive collaboration": "The degree of collaboration changes from project to project. Some problems clearly fall within the purview of a particular specialist, some will require an entire team to solve, and some require sub-groups of a team. Some clients can solve problems on their own and some require more hands-on guidance.", "Building projects around motivated individuals": "Organizational and technological constraints always matter. We can\u2019t advise organizations to put all their investments into bleeding-edge solutions if they don\u2019t have the capacity to recover if these solutions fail. We should encourage change, but always track ROI.", "Effective communication across team channels": "Rather than mandating one form of communication, strive to build more coordinated communication across individuals within teams. This would be more of a tactical, cross-functional approach to communication, rather than mandating everyone be in the same room for every project. Tools promoting collaborative design like Slack and UXPin help consolidate documentation and feedback in one place. ", "Working applications and high-quality UX as success benchmarks": "Your application can make a million decisions for users at the first keystroke or gesture, but if users don\u2019t see that value, your product will mostly likely fall flat. At the same time, the most bleeding-edge technology is useless if proof-of-concept isn\u2019t achieved early through lo-fi prototyping.", "Sustainable development": "This goes back to principle 3. Some features within a specific application will probably become obsolete in future versions. New features are also the lifeblood of successful product launches. Product iterations should always be a balancing act between what existing customers expect and what new customers need.", "Technical excellence is relative": "In some organizations, like institutions of higher education or non-profits, for example, the most viable solutions might be considered obsolete in other venues. And that\u2019s OK because we must consider price-point and organizational capacity. A small non-profit has very different technical requirements than a multinational corporation.", "Simplicity": "Again, it depends. The simplest solution isn\u2019t always the best one, especially if that solution neglects user, organizational, or technical realities.", "Cross-functional teams": "UX specialization is nothing to be feared. Silos are the real problem. When specialists don\u2019t talk to one another, we get products that neglect one or more elements. As long as productive, cross-channel communication is happening within organizations, then specialization is okay.", "Adaptable, flexible teams": "Self-reflection is great, but can teams adapt to new challenges?

Users will tire of complicated passages of dialogue.", "Respect the chat medium": "One advantage of smart messaging apps is that we can strip away a lot of apps and interface and reduce the interaction to a simple chat UI. It would therefore be pointless to turn around and drop an entire app directly into a conversation. Keep everything native to the conversational back-and-forth. Every bot interaction is about call and response, with the bot publishing comments into the chat thread and the end user responding in the reply area. Bots can\u2019t modify conversations in ways that humans can. At the same time, make use of conventions: rather than printing out an ungainly URL in a bot response, show a nicely-formatted card previewing the linked page.", "Optimise for the end user": "Bots should be used to improve the end user experience, not just to make life easier for customer support teams. A designer should ask themselves: would a human be better for the end user? If the answer is yes, you shouldn\u2019t be using a bot. Bots should not attempt to replace what humans are good at; rather they should attempt to improve what humans are slow at. Machines should work; people should think.", "Use sparingly": "Bot interactions should be short and precise. It should be impossible to get into a protracted back and forth conversation with a bot; anything above two inputs feels laborious.", "Provide an escape hatch": "Always have a human fallback option, allowing the user to express \u201cI\u2019d rather wait and talk to a real human, make this robot thing go away\u201c.", "Use structured input when possible": "The more alleyways a conversation can go down, the greater the potential for dead ends. Don\u2019t place users in a situation where they need to guess the correct incantation required to proceed. Custom soft keyboards permit a limited range of input and can save a bunch of typing. For example, rather than asking the end user to type \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d show them two mutually exclusive buttons. Or validate structured text like email addresses before sending. In this way you can keep responses on track and sidestep the complications of parsing unpredictable plain text input.", "Everyone sees the same thing": "Bots don\u2019t only appear to the end user. The humans behind the bots need a record of the conversation\u2019s context too \u2013 how a bot replied and how end users responded accordingly.

He remembers your likes and dislikes so that he can please you in the future. Everyone appreciates being treated according to his or her personal tastes.Most software, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t know or care who is using it. Little, if any, of the personal software on our personal computers seems to remember anything personal about us, in spite of the fact that we use it constantly, repetitively, and exclusively. A good example of this behavior is how browsers such as Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer remember information that users routinely enter into forms on websites, such as a shipping address or username. Google Chrome even remembers these details across devices and sessions.Software should work hard to remember our habits and, particularly, everything we tell it. From the perspective of a developer writing an application, it can be tempting to think about gathering a bit of information from a person as being similar to gathering a bit of information from a database. Every time the information is needed, the product asks the user for it. The application then discards that tidbit, assuming that it might change and that it can merely ask for it again if necessary. Not only are digital products better suited to recording things in memory than humans are, but our products also show they are inconsiderate when they forget. Remembering humans\u2019 actions and preferences is one of the best ways to create a positive experience with a software-enabled product.", "Considerate products are deferential": "A good service provider defers to her client. She understands that the person she is serving is the boss. When a restaurant host shows us to a table in a restaurant, we consider his choice of table to be a suggestion, not an order. If we politely request another table in an otherwise empty restaurant, we expect to be accommodated. If the host refuses, we are likely to choose a different restaurant where our desires take precedence over the host\u2019s.Inconsiderate products supervise and pass judgment on human actions. Software is within its rights to express its opinion that we are making a mistake, but it is presumptuous for it to judge or limit our actions. Software can suggest that we not \u201csubmit\u201d our entry until we\u2019ve typed in our telephone number, and it should explain the consequences if we do so, but if we want to \u201csubmit\u201d without the number, we expect the software to do as it is told. The very word submit is a reversal of the deferential relationship we should expect from interactive products. Software should submit to users. Any application that proffers a \u201csubmit\u201d button is being rude, as well as oblique and confusing.", "Considerate products are forthcoming": "If you ask a good retail sales associate for help locating an item, he will not only answer your question, but also volunteer useful collateral information. For example, he might tell you that a more expensive, higher-quality item than the one you requested is currently on sale for a similar price.Most software doesn\u2019t attempt to provide related information. Instead, it narrowly answers the precise questions we ask it and typically is not forthcoming about other information, even if it is clearly related to our goals. When we tell our word processor to print a document, it doesn\u2019t tell us when the paper supply is low, or when 40 other documents are queued before us, or when another nearby printer is free. A helpful human would.Figuring out the right way to offer potentially useful information can require a delicate touch. Microsoft\u2019s Office Assistant \u201cClippy\u201d was almost universally despised for his smarty-pants comments like \u201cIt looks like you\u2019re writing a letter. Would you like help?\u201d While we applauded his sentiment, we wished he weren\u2019t so obtrusive and could take a hint when it was clear we didn\u2019t want his help. After all, a good waiter doesn\u2019t interrupt your conversation to ask you if you want more water. He just refills your glass when it\u2019s empty, and he knows better than to linger when it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re in the middle of an intimate moment.", "Considerate products use common sense": "Offering inappropriate functions in inappropriate places is a hallmark of poorly designed interactive products. Many interactive products put controls for constantly used functions right next to never-used controls. You can easily find menus offering simple, harmless functions adjacent to irreversible ejector-seat-lever expert functions. It\u2019s like being seated at a dining table right next to an open grill.Horror stories also abound of customers offended by computer systems that repeatedly sent them checks for $0.00 or bills for $957,142,039.58. One would think that the system might alert a human in the Accounts Receivable or Payable departments when an event like this happens, especially more than once, but common sense remains a rarity in most information systems.", "Considerate products use discretion": "Generally speaking, we want our software to remember what we do and what we tell it. But there are some things our that software probably shouldn\u2019t remember unless we specifically direct it, such as credit card numbers, tax IDs, bank accounts, and passwords. Furthermore, it should help us protect this kind of private data by helping us choose secure passwords, and reporting any possible improprieties, such as accounts accessed from an unrecognized computer or location.", "Considerate products anticipate people\u2019s needs": "A human assistant knows that you will require a hotel room when you travel to another city, even when you don\u2019t ask explicitly. She knows the kind of room you like and reserves one without any request on your part. She anticipates your needs.A web browser spends most of its time idling while we peruse web pages. It could easily anticipate our needs and prepare for them while we are reading. It could use that idle time to preload all the links that are visible. Chances are good that we will soon ask the browser to examine one or more of those links. It is easy to abort an unwanted request, but it is always time-consuming to wait for a request to be filled. ", "Considerate products are conscientious": "A conscientious person has a larger perspective on what it means to perform a task. Instead of just washing the dishes, for example, a conscientious person also wipes down the counters and empties the trash, because those tasks are also related to the larger goal: cleaning up the kitchen. A conscientious person, when drafting a report, also puts a handsome cover page on it and makes enough photocopies for the entire department.Here\u2019s an example: If we hand our imaginary assistant, Rodney, a manila folder and tell him to file it, he checks the writing on the folder\u2019s tab\u2014let\u2019s say it reads MicroBlitz Contract\u2014and proceeds to find the correct place for it in the filing cabinet. Under M, he finds, to his surprise, a manila folder already there with the same name. Rodney notices the discrepancy and finds that the existing folder contains a contract for 17 widgets delivered four months ago. The new folder, on the other hand, is for 34 sprockets slated for production and delivery in the next quarter. Conscientious Rodney changes the name on the old folder to read MicroBlitz Widget Contract, 7/13 and then changes the name of the new folder to read MicroBlitz Sprocket Contract, 11/13. This type of initiative is why we think Rodney is conscientious.Our former imaginary assistant, Elliot, was a complete idiot. He was not conscientious at all. If he were placed in the same situation, he would have dumped the new MicroBlitz Contract folder next to the old MicroBlitz Contract folder without a second thought. Sure, he got it safely filed, but he could have done a better job that would have improved our ability to find the right contract in the future. That\u2019s why Elliot isn\u2019t our imaginary assistant anymore.If we rely on a typical word processor to draft the new sprocket contract and then try to save it in the MicroBlitz folder, the application offers the choice of either overwriting and destroying the old widget contract or not saving it at all. The application not only isn\u2019t as capable as Rodney, it isn\u2019t even as capable as Elliot. The software is dumb enough to assume that because two folders have the same name, we meant to throw away the old one.The application should, at the very least, mark the two files with different dates and save them. Even if the application refuses to take this \u201cdrastic\u201d action unilaterally, it could at least show us the old file (letting us rename that one) before saving the new one. The application could take numerous actions that would be more conscientious.", "Considerate products don\u2019t burden you with their personal problems": "At a service desk, the agent is expected to keep mum about her problems and to show a reasonable interest in yours. It might not be fair to be so one-sided, but that\u2019s the nature of the service business. An interactive product, too, should keep quiet about its problems and show interest in the people who use it. Because computers don\u2019t have egos or tender sensibilities, they should be perfect in this role, but they typically behave the opposite way.Software whines at us with error messages, interrupts us with confirmation dialog boxes, and brags to us with unnecessary notifiers (\u201cDocument Successfully Saved!\u201d How nice for you, Mr. App: Do you ever unsuccessfully save?). We aren\u2019t interested in the application\u2019s crisis of confidence about whether to purge its Recycle Bin. We don\u2019t want to hear its whining about being unsure where to put a file on disk. We don\u2019t need to see information about the computer\u2019s data transfer rates and its loading sequence, any more than we need information about the customer service agent\u2019s unhappy love affair. Not only should software keep quiet about its problems, but it should also have the intelligence, confidence, and authority to fix its problems on its own.", "Considerate products keep you informed": "Although we don\u2019t want our software pestering us incessantly with its little fears and triumphs, we do want to be kept informed about the things that matter to us. We don\u2019t want our local bartender to grouse to us about his recent divorce, but we appreciate it when he posts his prices in plain sight and when he writes what time the pregame party begins on his chalkboard, along with who\u2019s playing and the current Vegas spread. Nobody interrupts us to tell us this information: It\u2019s there in plain view whenever we need it. Software, similarly, can provide us with this kind of rich modeless feedback about what is going on.", "Considerate products are perceptive": "Most of our existing software is not very perceptive. It has a very narrow understanding of the scope of most problems. It may willingly perform difficult work, but only when given the precise command at precisely the correct time. For example, if you ask the inventory query system how many widgets are in stock, it will dutifully ask the database and report the number as of the time you ask. But what if, 20 minutes later, someone in the Dallas office cleans out the entire stock of widgets? You are now operating under a potentially embarrassing misconception, while your computer sits there, idling away billions of wasted instructions. It is not being perceptive. If you want to know about widgets once, isn\u2019t that a good clue that you probably will want to know about widgets again? You may not want to hear widget status reports every day for the rest of your life, but maybe you\u2019ll want to get them for the rest of the week. Perceptive software observes what users are doing and uses those observations to offer relevant information.Products should also watch our preferences and remember them without being asked explicitly to do so. If we always maximize an application to use the entire available screen, the application should get the idea after a few sessions and always launch in that configuration. The same goes for placement of palettes, default tools, frequently used templates, and other useful settings.", "Considerate products are self-confident": "Interactive products should stand by their convictions. If we tell the computer to discard a file, it shouldn\u2019t ask, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Of course we\u2019re sure; otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t have asked. It shouldn\u2019t second-guess us or itself.On the other hand, if the computer has any suspicion that we might be wrong (which is always), it should anticipate our changing our minds by being prepared to undelete the file upon our request.How often have you clicked the Print button and then gone to get a cup of coffee, only to return to find a fearful dialog box quivering in the middle of the screen, asking, \u201cAre you sure you want to print?\u201d This insecurity is infuriating and the antithesis of considerate human behavior.", "Considerate products don\u2019t ask a lot of questions": "Inconsiderate products ask lots of annoying questions. Excessive choices, especially in the form of questions, quickly stop being a benefit and instead become an ordeal.Asking questions is quite different from providing choices. When browsing on your own in a store, you are presented with choices. When going to a job interview, you are asked questions. Which is the more pleasurable experience? Part of the reason why is that individual asking the questions is understood to be in a position superior to the individual being asked. Those with authority ask questions; subordinates respond. When software asks questions rather than offering choices, users feel disempowered.Beyond the power dynamics issues, questions also tend to make people feel badgered and harassed. Would you like soup or salad? Salad. Would you like cabbage or spinach? Spinach. Would you like French, Thousand Island, or Italian? French. Would you like lite or regular? Stop! Please, just bring me the soup instead! Would you like corn chowder or chicken noodle?Users really don\u2019t like to be asked questions by products, especially since most of the questions are stupid or unnecessary. Asking questions tells users that products are:These are all qualities that we typically dislike in people. Why should we desire them in our products? The application is not asking us our opinion out of intellectual curiosity or a desire to make conversation, the way a friend might over dinner. Rather, it is behaving ignorantly while also representing itself as having false authority. The application isn\u2019t interested in our opinions; it requires information\u2014often information it didn\u2019t really need to ask us in the first place.Many ATMs continually ask users what language they prefer: \u201cSpanish, English, or Chinese?\u201d This answer is unlikely to change after a person\u2019s first use. Interactive products that ask fewer questions, provide choices without asking questions, and remember information they have already learned appear smarter to users, as well as more polite and considerate.", "Considerate products fail gracefully": "When your friend commits a serious faux pas, he tries to make amends and undo the damage. When an application discovers a fatal problem, it can take the time and effort to prepare for its failure without hurting the user, or it can simply crash and burn.Many applications are filled with data and settings. When they crash, that information is still often discarded. The user is left holding the bag. For example, say an application is computing merrily along, downloading your e-mail from a server, when it runs out of memory at some procedure buried deep in the application\u2019s internals. The application, like most desktop software, issues a message that says, in effect, \u201cYou are hosed,\u201d and it terminates immediately after you click OK. You restart the application, or sometimes the whole computer, only to find that the application lost your e-mail. When you interrogate the server, you find that it has also erased your e-mail because the e-mail was already handed over to your application. This is not what we should expect of good software.In this example, the application accepted e-mail from the server\u2014which then erased its copy\u2014but it didn\u2019t ensure that the e-mail was properly recorded locally. If the e-mail application had ensured that those messages were promptly written to the local disk, even before it informed the server that the messages were successfully downloaded, the problem would never have arisen.Some well-designed software products, such as Ableton Live, a brilliant music performance tool, rely on the Undo cache to recover from crashes. This is a great example of how products can easily keep track of user behavior, so if some situation causes problems, it is easy to extricate yourself.Even when applications don\u2019t crash, inconsiderate behavior is rife, particularly on the web. Users often need to enter information into a set of forms on a page. After filling in 10 or 11 fields, a user might click the Submit button, and, due to some mistake or omission on his part, have the site reject his input and tell him to correct it. The user then clicks the back arrow to return to the page, and lo, the 10 valid entries were inconsiderately discarded along with the single invalid one. Remember your incredibly mean junior high geography teacher who ripped up your report on South America because you wrote it in pencil instead of ink? And as a result, you hate geography to this day? Don\u2019t create products that act like that!", "Considerate products know when to bend the rules": "When manual information-processing systems are translated into computerized systems, something is lost in the process. Although an automated order-entry system can handle millions more orders than a human clerk can, the human clerk can work the system in a way that most automated systems ignore. There is almost never a way to jigger the functioning to give or take slight advantages in an automated system.In a manual system, when the clerk\u2019s friend from the sales force tells him that getting a particular order processed speedily means additional business, the clerk can expedite that one order. When another order comes in with some critical information missing, the clerk still can process it, remembering to acquire and record the information later. This flexibility usually is absent from automated systems.Most computerized systems have only two states: nonexistence and full compliance. No intermediate states are recognized or accepted. Every manual system has an important but paradoxical state\u2014unspoken, undocumented, but widely relied upon\u2014suspense. In this state a transaction can be accepted even though it is not fully processed. The human operator creates that state in his head or on his desk or in his back pocket.For example, suppose a digital system needs both customer and order information before it can post an invoice. Whereas the human clerk can go ahead and post an order before having detailed customer information, the computerized system rejects the transaction, unwilling to allow the invoice to be entered without it.The characteristic of manual systems that lets humans perform actions out of sequence or before prerequisites are satisfied is called fudgeability. It is one of the first casualties when systems are computerized, and its absence is a key contributor to the inhumanity of digital systems. It is a natural result of the implementation model. Developers don\u2019t always see a reason to create intermediate states, because the computer has no need for them. Yet there are strong human needs to be able to bend the system slightly.One of the benefits of fudgeable systems is reducing the number of mistakes. By allowing many small, temporary mistakes into the system and entrusting humans to correct them before they cause problems downstream, we can avoid much bigger, more permanent mistakes. Paradoxically, most of the hard-edged rules enforced by computer systems are imposed to prevent just such mistakes. These inflexible rules make the human and the software adversaries. Because the human is prevented from fudging to prevent big mistakes, he soon stops caring about protecting the software from colossal problems. When inflexible rules are imposed on flexible humans, both sides lose. It is bad for business to prevent humans from doing things the way they want, and the computer system usually ends up having to digest invalid data anyway.In the real world, both missing information and extra information that doesn\u2019t fit into a standard field are important tools for success. For example, suppose a transaction can be completed only if the termination date is extended two weeks beyond the official limit. Most companies would rather fudge on the termination date than see a million-dollar deal go up in smoke. In the real world, limits are fudged all the time. Considerate products need to realize and embrace this fact.", "Considerate products take responsibility": "Too many interactive products take the attitude that \u201cIt isn\u2019t my responsibility.\u201d When they pass along a job to some hardware device, they wash their hands of the action, leaving the stupid hardware to finish. Any user can see that the software isn\u2019t being considerate or conscientious, that the software isn\u2019t shouldering its part of the burden of helping the user become more effective.In a typical print operation, for example, an application begins sending a 20-page report to the printer and simultaneously displays a print process dialog box with a Cancel button. If the user quickly realizes that he forgot to make an important change, he clicks the Cancel button just as the first page emerges from the printer. The application immediately cancels the print operation. But unbeknownst to the user, while the printer was beginning to work on page 1, the computer had already sent 15 pages to the printer\u2019s buffer. The application cancels the last five pages, but the printer doesn\u2019t know about the cancellation; it just knows that it was sent 15 pages, so it goes ahead and prints them. Meanwhile, the application smugly tells the user that the function was canceled. The application lies, as the user can plainly see.The user is unsympathetic to the communication problems between the application and the printer. He doesn\u2019t care that the communications are one-way. All he knows is that he decided not to print the document before the first page appeared in the printer\u2019s output tray, he clicked the Cancel button, and then the stupid application continued printing for 15 pages even after it acknowledged his Cancel command.Imagine what his experience would be if the application could properly communicate with the print driver. If the software were smart enough, the print job could easily have been abandoned before the second sheet of paper was wasted. The printer has a Cancel function\u2014it\u2019s just that the software was built to be too lazy to use it.", "Considerate products help you avoid awkward mistakes": "If a helpful human companion saw you about to do something that you would almost certainly regret afterwards\u2014like shouting about your personal life in a room full of strangers, or sending an empty envelope in the mail to your boss\u2014they might take you quietly aside and gently alert you to your mistake.Digital products should similarly help you realize when you are, for example, about to inadvertently send a text to your entire list of contacts instead of the one friend you were intending to confide in, or are about to send an e-mail to the director of your department without the quarterly report you mentioned you were enclosing in the text of your message.The intervention should not, however, be in the form of a standard modal error message box that stops the action and adds insult to injury, but rather through careful visual and textual feedback that lets you know that you are messaging a group rather than a person, or that you haven\u2019t enclosed any attachments even though you mentioned that you were.For this latter situation, your e-mail app might even modelessly highlight the drop area for you to drag your attachment to, while at the same time giving you the option of just going ahead and sending the message sans attachments, in case the software got your intentions wrong.Products that go the extra mile in looking out for users by helping them prevent embarrassing mistakes\u2014and not berating them for it\u2014will quickly earn their trust and devotion. All other things equal, considerate product design is one of the things, and perhaps even the thing, that distinguishes an only passable app from a truly great one."}}, {"heading": "Eight Principles of Information Architecture", "link": "/collections/eight-principles-of-information-architecture", "author": "Dan Brown", "sourcetext": "Eight Principles of Information Architecture (pdf)", "sourceurl": "https://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Aug-10/AugSep10_Brown.pdf", "detail": {"Principle of objects": "Treat content as a living, breathing thing with a lifecycle, behaviors and attributes.", "Principle of choices": "Create pages that offer meaningful choices to users, keeping the range of choices available focused on a particular task.", "Principle of disclosure": "Show only enough information to help people understand what kinds of information they\u2019ll find as they dig deeper.", "Principle of exemplars": "Describe the contents of categories by showing examples of the contents.", "Principle of front doors": "Assume at least half of the website\u2019s visitors will come through some page other than the home page.", " Principle of multiple classification": "Offer users several different classification schemes to browse the site\u2019s content.", "Principle of focused navigation": "The principle of focused navigation \u2013 Don\u2019t mix apples and oranges in your navigation scheme.", "Principle of growth": "Assume the content you have today is a small fraction of the content you will have tomorrow."}}, {"heading": "Quartz Design Principles", "link": "/collections/quartz-design-principles", "author": "Quartz", "sourcetext": "The 'guiding principles' of Quartz redesign", "sourceurl": "https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/the-guiding-principles-of-mobile-and-social-in-quartz-redesign/s2/a562265/", "detail": {"Stay out of the users' way": "", "Let the stories shine": "", "Make sure it works on mobile": "", "Remove before adding": "", "Pick one thing before another": "", "Make small dicisions made on data and big decisions with your gut": ""}}, {"heading": "Designing for Virtual Reality", "link": "/collections/designing-for-virtual-reality", "author": "Google", "sourcetext": "Designing for Virtual Reality", "sourceurl": "http://ustwo.com/blog/designing-for-virtual-reality-google-cardboard/", "detail": {"Using a Reticle": "Without a visual aid it's hard to tell when objects are actually in the center of your view.

They are worn publicly to express our sense of fashion and style, but at the same time they can display extremely personal data. With these new devices, we may find ourselves \u201cwearing\u201d some of the most personal aspects of ourselves: our conversations, relationships, and even health. Unlike our smartphones which we can conceal in the privacy of our pockets, wearables may ironically be the most intimate and public devices yet. When designing for this paradox, we should keep in mind this precarious tipping point between Public and Personal.We Suggest\n- Sense which way the device is facing \u2013 display content accordingly.\n- Vibrate first, display second.\n- Give the user control but ship with considerate defaults.", "Keep it Glanceable": "Screen real estate (if the device even has a screen) is extremely limited, so exposing users to the smallest amount of data possible to help them achieve their goals is key. Designs overloaded with detailed information will require too much attention, may distract users or compete with their social context. In most scenarios, services should show one piece of information at a time. Make it count.We Suggest\n- Show one thing at a time.\n- Keep it simple for users. Their dates will thank you.", "Leverage Non-Visual UI": "Wearable displays are a lot smaller than we are used to. However, with constraint comes opportunity. To make up for their lack of screen size and visual-based interactions, many wearables offer new and different ways to input and receive information. Gesture recognition, tapping patterns, health data and vibrational communication are all some of the capabilities that will enable the future of screen-less interactions. Fist bump to tweet!We Suggest\n- Consider some new inputs, like gesture, voice, health and tapping.\n- Notify with nuanced feedback \u2013 haptics, vibrations and sounds.", "Beware of the Data Avalanche": "Today, we have a ton of access to data and communications, so prioritizing is essential. We should focus on delivering only the most important information when the user needs it, creating experiences that support rather than overwhelm. The goal is to create a system that elegantly stays in the background of our lives while supporting specific tasks. Don\u2019t let it snowball out of control!We Suggest\n- Interact with users only at the right moments.\n- Let them decide how much they want to hear from you.", "Mind the Gaps": "Wearables are the newest addition to our digital lives.

You\u2019ve probably also heard the opposite\u2014there are no rules\u2014it\u2019s the job of innovators to disregard convention. Which of these is true?Oddly, both. This is the Genius Paradox. You have to disobey the rules of creativity to obey the rules of creativity. And in obeying the rules of creativity, you automatically disobey the rules of creativity. That\u2019s because the number one rule is to break the rules.Creative rules are not rigid dictates but rough principles\u2014patterns that a variety of artists, scientists, and thinkers have used for centuries as the scaffolding for their inventions. You shouldn\u2019t be a slave to them. You don\u2019t need to keep them in your conscious mind. But having considered them will broaden your repertoire for any creative challenge that calls for a rich response. The simplest way to resolve the Genius Paradox is this:1) React to the rules by embracing them or breaking them.2) Observe the results.3) Rewrite the rules from your own experience.You\u2019ll find that there are rules for creativity\u2014your rules. They may not be the ones that others follow, but they\u2019ll be true and useful to you.One caveat: Make sure your new principles are not just scars from a previous experience\u2014it\u2019s easy to draw the wrong conclusion from a single failure. Weigh your newly forged rules against the rules of the ages to make sure they have the heft and hardiness to do the job.", "Wish for what you want": "Wishing is a warm-up sketch for problem solving. When you let your mind wander across the blank page of possibilities, all constraints and preconceptions disappear, leaving only the trace of a barely glimpsed dream, the merest hint of a sketch of an idea.To start wishing, ask yourself the kind of questions that begin:How might I\u2026?\nWhat\u2019s stopping us from\u2026?\nIn what ways could I\u2026?\nWhat would happen if\u2026?\nFrom there you can ask follow-up questions like:\nWhy would we\u2026?\nWhat has changed to allow us to\u2026?\nWho would need to\u2026?\nWhen should I\u2026?At this stage there\u2019s no reason to place limits on your wandering. What\u2019s the can\u2019t-do that you wish were a can-do? The future problem you could start solving now? The half-baked notion you\u2019d like to see a reality? Where is the place where the suddenly possible meets the desperately necessary? Wishing allows you to leave the realm of limitations, if only for a few moments, to imagine a future worth pursuing.", "Feel before you think": "Don\u2019t jump into planning as soon as you\u2019ve sighted a goal. Learn to be still and listen. Pay attention to the nagging voice. The uneasy stomach. The barely felt longing. Your subject may have something to tell you.Resist the temptation to impose a cookie-cutter solution on an intriguing problem, or a groundbreaking solution on an insignificant problem. Hold back until you\u2019ve had enough time to sort through your feelings and consider the issues. Depending on the nature and scope of the challenge, this could take five seconds or five days. It takes what it takes.Have you ever noticed that when you\u2019re searching for facts, you\u2019ll cast your eyes downward as if the information were on the table? And when you\u2019re trying to invent an answer, you\u2019ll look upward as if the solution were in the clouds? These are commonly observed tendencies in problem solvers. But when you\u2019re trying to access your intuition, looking won\u2019t help at all. You\u2019ll need to feel.Feeling your way to a solution is like an athlete deciding his or her next move. It happens more in the body than the brain. It gives you direct access to your intuition so you can bypass the usual fears, distractions, default solutions, and ego traps that can make your work less than brilliant. Feeling lets you forge a connection with your subject that mere thinking can\u2019t reach.Close your eyes and drift with the problem. Let it whisper to you. Imagine you\u2019re a psychologist, and the problem is your patient. Listen carefully. Give it your deepest empathy and fullest attention. Be available to the problem. Don\u2019t try to fix it. Feel your way forward.", "See what's not there": "One of the skills that separates a leader from a follower is the ability to see what might be, but so far isn\u2019t. Most people can see what\u2019s already there. You don\u2019t need magic glasses to see that the Eiffel Tower is a popular tourist destination, or that the area of a rectangle is the product of its height and width, or that millions of people will pay extra for a fancy cup of coffee. But you do need magic glasses to see what\u2019s still missing from the world, since by definition what\u2019s missing is invisible.The trick is to notice what artists and designers call negative space. It\u2019s the plain background of painting, the white space on a printed page, the silence between lines of a play, or the rests within a musical score. In the world of art, these are purposeful elements of composition. In the marketplace, these are crevices that harbor hidden opportunity.Try these three techniques for finding the negative space in a marketplace, a problem, or a situation:Sift through threats for hidden possibilities. Every threat carries with it the potential for innovation. The threat of obesity contains the possibility of new kinds of nutrition. The threat of global pollution contains the possibility of new energy sources. The threat of unemployment contains the possibility of new educational models. The list is endless, if you can learn to see what\u2019s not there.Examine sectors for uneven rates of change. The future is already here, goes the saying\u2014it\u2019s just unevenly distributed. Look for areas that have changed, then look for similar or adjacent areas that have not changed. Look for pockets of resistance to successful new ideas. Chances are, it\u2019s only a matter of time before change comes.Imagine how a growing trend might affect an established norm. Make a list of nascent and dominant trends, then mentally apply them to industries, businesses, and activities that haven\u2019t changed for a long while. What will the trend towards organic farming mean for fast-food restaurants? What will mobile payments do to retail shopping habits? How might nanotechnology change the energy market? What will always-on computing change the college experience?To find out what\u2019s not there, think about the job not done, the road not taken, the product not made. These are the magic glasses that let you see the invisible and conceive the inconceivable.", "Ask a bigger question": "Figure out what type of problem you\u2019re solving. Is it a simple problem? A complex problem? A structural problem? A communication problem? A technology problem? A political problem? A design problem? A budgetary problem? A leadership problem? Unless you know what type of problem you\u2019re solving, your solution will be wrong, no matter how well you solve it.For most of us, the problems we tackle are given to us by someone else\u2014a boss, a teacher, a client, a committee, an organization. While the problem may seem logical in the way it\u2019s stated, a little bit of probing may reveal a faulty framework. The framework is the boundary drawn around it, the \u201crope of scope\u201d that keeps it from sprawling to infinity. It narrows the focus, suggests a direction for the work, limits the investment, and determines how success is measured. If the framework is wrong, everything else will be wrong.Your first impulse may be to accept the problem as stated. Resist. Be curious. Ask questions. Probe further. While it may seem disrespectful or annoying to pester your problem-giver with too many questions at once, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t raise them mentally and marshal your thoughts for a later conversation. In fact, you may not even have any questions at first. Sometimes questions need time to rise to the surface.As you become more proficient at accepting assignments, you\u2019ll find questions like these helpful:Have we seen this problem before?What do we already know about it?Are these boundaries the right boundaries?Should we solve a bigger problem instead?If we succeed, what will be improved?What will be diminished? What will be replaced?What opportunities will it spawn?Who stands to gain? Who stands to lose?Do we need to solve the problem at all?Who says? So what? Why not?By asking a bigger question, you may find that the boundaries of the problem were drawn too small. The actual problem was more important, and the only reason to minimize it was to shrink it to fit a budget, a time frame, a job description, or a skill set. While these may be issues, it\u2019s better to face them head on and make them part of the brief.Or you may find that the frame was drawn the right size, but around the wrong challenge. The first question in creating something new is not how to, but what to.", "Frame problems tightly": "There\u2019s a widespread myth that genius needs a large canvas. Yet every creative person knows this to be untrue. Too much freedom can lead to mediocrity. Why? Because without boundaries there\u2019s no incentive to break through them. A real genius has no difficulty redefining a brief or defying convention. It\u2019s second nature. But give a creative person too much freedom, and you\u2019ll get a final product that\u2019s over-designed, over-worked, over-budget, and under-focused. The greatest gift you can give a genius is limitation, not license.The basic principle is this: A tightly structured brief will generate energy; a wide-open one will drain it. When creative people get into trouble, it\u2019s not because they can\u2019t see the solution\u2014it\u2019s because they can\u2019t see the problem. Here\u2019s a formula for framing a challenge in a way that lets you clearly see it:Write a problem statement. Summarize the challenge in a brief paragraph, then describe the most likely outcome if it\u2019s not addressed.List the constraints. Constraints are creative limitations imposed by the problem. Is there a funding limit? A time limit? A technological barrier? A political barrier? A business constraint? A brand constraint? A knowledge gap? Competitive hurdles? Limitations are important because they tighten the frame and point to solutions.List the affordances. Affordances are creative possibilities that exist within the problem. While constraints close the door, affordances open a window. Constraints and affordances shape the space where new ideas can dance. What\u2019s missing from the market? What are the capabilities can I call on? Who do I have on my team? How can the technology be advanced? What does the problem tell me? Inside every problem is a hidden solution.Describe success. Your problem statement suggests the most likely outcome of doing nothing. Now describe the most likely outcome if your solution succeeds.A problem well-framed is a problem half-solved.", "Think whole thoughts": "The human mind loves either/or choices. We prefer a choice of A or B. Yes or no. Chicken or beef. Simple choices give us a feeling of control, while open-ended choices give us a feeling of unease. Therefore we\u2019d rather choose between than among.By the same token, we prefer to break complex problems into separate parts. It\u2019s easier to focus on a single part than to hold a complex problem in our brains. Yet without a good view of the whole problem, we won\u2019t be able to see how the parts fit together.To complicate matters further, we\u2019re easily fooled by our emotions and intuition\u2014the very instruments we rely on to guide us through the thickets of innovation.The fact is, the human mind is a mass of biases. Beginners are fooled by what they believe; experts are fooled by what they know. And the biggest bias of all is believing you\u2019re not biased.The counterweight to bias is thinking in whole thoughts instead of fragments. Squint your mind to blur the details. Look for how the parts of the problem fit together. View a complex situation from a variety of angles so you can see the hidden connections and surprising possibilities. Start by examining it from three basic positions:First position, or the view from your own vantage point. Easy, but not always trustworthy.Second position, or views from the vantage points of other relevant players. More difficult, requiring empathy and observation.Metaposition, or the view from outside the system. The most difficult of all, requiring objectivity and critical thinking, which don\u2019t come naturally to most of us.The term for this \u201cunnatural\u201d style of thinking is systems thinking. It\u2019s a method of understanding complex problems by studying the relationships of the parts to the whole. It\u2019s a way to see the big picture and how it changes over time, more like watching a movie than viewing a snapshot.Systems thinking lets you solve problems by respecting their context. For example, when designing a chair, consider the room it will reside in. When planning a room, think about the house it\u2019s part of. When conceiving a house, respect the community it belongs to. When managing a community, consider the environment it\u2019s supported by.When you think whole thoughts instead of fragments, you create solutions, products, or experiences that resonate with the larger world, and thereby create broad, sustained value.", "Stay in the dragon pit": "The \u201cdragon pit\u201d is the gap between what is and what could be. It\u2019s a space filled with discomfort, darkness, and doubt. Most people would rather grab the first rope thrown to them\u2014what is\u2014rather than stay and fight the dragons guarding what could be. But what could be is where the ideas are. A genius is someone who can tolerate the discomfort of uncertainty while generating as many ideas as possible.The unresolved conflict of the dragon pit is actually a prime source of creative energy. The gap between vision and reality produces creative tension, which can only be released by a new idea. Without creative tension, there\u2019s no need to push forward to an alternate reality. Inevitably, the result of tension-free thinking is business as usual.The secret of creativity is to keep your ideas in a \u201cliquid state.\u201d Let them mutate, morph, and recombine as they bump into one another. Avoid the tyranny of no and the na\u00efvete of yes, all the while holding onto to the hopefulness of maybe. Often this requires courage, especially when the stakes are high. The cave you fear to enter, goes the ancient proverb, holds the treasure that you seek.Creative thinking requires that you leave the known and venture into the unknown. This can be difficult if you\u2019re deeply knowledgeable about your challenge, your discipline, or your industry. The known is an attractor state, a default position that pulls your mind like a magnet.When you find yourself stuck in your own knowledge, get unstuck quickly. Ask yourself why you\u2019re stuck. Is it a lack of information? If so, get it. A lack of skills? Go develop them. Is it that the solution doesn\u2019t exist? Move on to the next dragon.", "Approach answers obliquely": "The hallmark of innovation is surprise. No surprise, nothing new. Nothing new, no interest. No interest, no value. Therefore, creating surprise is a crucial step in creating value through innovation.The first step in surprising others is to surprise yourself. This can be maddingly difficult, since you already know most of what you\u2019re likely to think of. You may need to trick your mind into new modes of thought by using one or more of the following techniques. Here are nine approaches that can help you make connections between seemingly unrelated ideas:Think in metaphors. A metaphor is a link between two dissimilar things: \u201cThe world is a stage.\u201d By equating the world with a stage, you can more easily imagine that we\u2019re all actors playing a part\u2014an insight you might not have had without the metaphor.Think in pictures. Visual thinking can strip a problem down to its essence, leading to profoundly simple connections that language by itself can\u2019t make. The ability to draw stick figures, arrows, and talk balloons is all you need to think visually.Start from a different place. When you grab for the \u201ccorrect\u201d solution, brilliant solutions will elude you. You\u2019ll get stuck in the tar pits of knowledge, unable to free your mind of what you already know. The easiest way to escape this trap is by rejecting the correct solution\u2014at least temporarily\u2014in favor of the \u201cwrong\u201d solution. While the worst idea can never be the best idea, it will take your imagination to a different starting place.Steal from other domains. If you steal an idea cleverly enough, the theft will go unnoticed. While stealing is not the same as pure imagination, it does take a mental leap to see how an idea from one industry or discipline could be adapted to another.Arrange blind dates. Great ideas are often two ideas that haven\u2019t previously been introduced. Using a technique called \u201ccombinatory play,\u201d you can throw unrelated ideas together to see if the create a new idea. Look for combinations that have a natural fit.Reverse the polarity. Write down as many assumptions about the problem as you can think of. Reverse them. Think about what it would take to make the reversed assumption true. Some of these may lead to new ideas.Ask simple questions. What else is this like? Who else believes this? What if I changed it slightly? What can I eliminate? What can I substitute? Is this the cause or the effect? What if I changed the timing? What if I made it bigger? What would happen if I did nothing?Watch for accidents. You can sometimes make the best discoveries when you\u2019re searching for something else. Pay attention to anomalies, surprises, or feedback that confounds your expectations. These can open up exciting new areas of inquiry.Write things down. Not all your ideas will be worthwhile, but they might trigger new ideas. Make a list of your thoughts as you work through any problem. Keep a notebook, a sketchbook, a scrapbook, or an idea file. A pencil can be a crowbar for lifting ideas from your subconscious.", "Wait for the jolt": "When the right idea comes along, your emotional brain sends a signal to the rest of your body. It\u2019s a tingle, a flash, or a jolt that tells you something remarkable has happened. Suddenly the world reels, a thousand gears snap into place, and the long-hidden answer appears, shimmering, before your disbelieving eyes. Developing a sensitivity to these signals is an integral part of being creative.But what if your idea is only new to you, and not to the rest of the world? And how do you know if it\u2019s any good in the first place? Here\u2019s where it helps to apply the six tests of originality:Is it disorienting? A great idea should be unsettling\u2014not just to you, but others in your group. Some people may reject it on the spot. This may be a good sign, since the potential of a new idea is often inversely proportional to its comfort factor.Does it kill ten birds? A good idea kills two birds with one stone. A great idea kills ten or twenty.Does it need to be proved? If an idea doesn\u2019t need to be tested, it\u2019s probably because it\u2019s not very original or not very bold. The skepticism that calls for a proof of concept is one of the signals of originality.Is it likely to force change? Great ideas are not polite. The never say they\u2019re sorry. They don\u2019t try to fit in. On the contrary, they force the rest of the world to change in self-defense.Does it create affordances? The measure of a great idea is the quantity and quality of affordances it throws off. Affordances are the opportunities inherent in an idea. The more affordances\u2014for customers, a company, an industry, or society at large\u2014the better the idea.Can it be summarized? A great idea can usually be described in a sentence. It has a strong internal order, one that answers to a clear and compelling purpose. If you find it hard to describe your idea, stop working on your description. Fix your idea.", "Use beauty as a yardstick": "The world\u2019s greatest scientists, philosophers, and artists agree: If an idea isn\u2019t beautiful, it\u2019s probably not innovative. They\u2019re putting a special spin on the word beautiful by defining beauty as a quality of wholeness, or harmony, that generates pleasure, meaning, and satisfaction. A beautiful idea is often a great idea.While beauty can\u2019t be reduced to a pat formula, it can be best understood by viewing it as a system with three interactive elements: surprise, rightness, and elegance.In everything we experience as beautiful, there\u2019s a moment of surprise when we first encounter it. Surprise is the jarring pop of disrupted expectations\u2014the jolt of rule #10. The pleasure, meaning, or satisfaction that follows this pop can be experienced as a warm glow, a slowly spreading smile, or the hair standing up on your arms. Physiologically, it\u2019s a blast of serotonin to your central nervous system.Rightness, the second element of beauty, is a kind of fitness for duty, a specific structure that allows the thing we\u2019re encountering to align with its purpose.Elegance, the third element, is a rejection of superfluous elements in favor of simplicity and efficiency. An elegant idea is one that has the fewest number of elements that allow the whole to achieve its purpose. The best ideas seem so perfect that they leave no room in the imagination for anything better.When all three of these elements are working well together, an idea has enormous potential to improve the context in which it exists.How can you create beauty in your own work? By shaping it according to the principles of design. Anyone can be a designer. All you need is the will and the skill to change an existing situation into a better one. The next section of the book lays out the basic rules.", "Design quickly, decide slowly": "The first eleven rules were concerned with getting the right idea. The next fourteen are concerned with getting the idea right. This is the work of bending, shaping, and polishing your idea so it aligns with its purpose. This is the point at which you go from thinker to maker.The default setting for traditional thinkers is to reach a decision as quickly as possible. In business, for example, managers tend to rely on a two-step process: know and do. They know something\u2014from a case study, a book, an article, a best practice, a previous experience\u2014and move straight to doing something. The failing of this process is that it cuts out the possibility of new ideas. The know-do process is incapable of finding new approaches or mitigating risk, so it plays safe: Just do what worked in the past, and nothing more.A better way to reach a decision is to make one. When you insert making between knowing and doing, you put new ideas on the table. You invent models, prototypes, or mockups that can be tested before they\u2019re selected. Making lets you design the way forward, instead of merely deciding the way forward. Deciding is much easier with a range of tested possibilities to choose from.The know-make-do process is at the heart of design thinking, the discipline at the core of innovation. It\u2019s the process of changing an existing situation to a new and better one. Design can be applied to an organization, a product, a building, or a policy. It can improve a career, a habit, a skill, or a relationship. Anything that can be changed can be designed.Yet new ideas are fragile. They can\u2019t stand up to withering criticism or the careless opinions of devil\u2019s advocates. Rejecting a new idea because it\u2019s not immediately successful is like giving up a baby because it can\u2019t hold a job. New ideas need to protection and nurturing. They need time to be shaped, tested, corrected, and polished.Does this mean that the know-make-do process will slow down decision making? Maybe yes, maybe no. But it beats the know-do process, which is guaranteed to produce sub-optimal results. When you\u2019re trying to innovate, it\u2019s best to design quickly and decide slowly. Hold your fire until you see a worthy target.", "Use a linear process for static elements": "The starting point for choosing a process is understanding what kind of system you\u2019re dealing with. Is it simple or complex? Are the elements static and unchanging or dynamic and unpredictable?Many projects have fairly static elements. Even a project as complex as a movie can be approached as a collection of simple parts. You can break the movie down into scenes, then break the scenes into shots and camera moves. Once you have a script in hand, it\u2019s easy to see how the scenes will fit together, at which point you can shoot them in whatever sequence you like. You can feel confident that the scenes will make sense when they\u2019re assembled into a finished product.Another example is the manufacturing process. Manufacturing gets its efficiencies from predictable steps. Some steps can be completed simultaneously, while others must be completed sequentially. But all the steps involve static parts that can be assembled at the end. You can then repeat the process endlessly, make small improvements over time, and scale it up when you\u2019re ready.These are examples of a linear process. There are many situations in which it works perfectly, such as producing an instruction manual, mounting a legal defense, or planning a wedding. In each of these cases, you might expect surprises and setbacks, but few that would require rethinking the entire project.On the other hand, you can\u2019t approach a musical composition in the same linear way. Any sequence of notes you add will change the character of the whole composition. Every new element suggests changes to the other elements, keeping the whole piece in constant motion. When you try to pin it down, it fights back. It\u2019s alive and dynamic.The same can be said of building a business, managing a brand, or designing an app. These are complex activities. They require a dynamic process.", "Use a dynamic process for reactive elements": "Complex problems are dynamic. They don\u2019t hold still while you work on them. The traditional approach is to address a complex problem as if it were a simple problem, breaking it into discrete steps that can be executed one at a time. Too often the result was 1) a solution that didn\u2019t address the real problem\n2) a solution that caused new problems, or \n3) a solution that was largely ineffective. Just because you\u2019ve ticked the boxes doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve solved the problem.Complex projects with interactive elements\u2014parts that change dynamically with every change to the whole\u2014require an all-at-once process instead of a step-by-step process. The way this unfolds depends on what the project is.Let\u2019s take the case of building a brand for a new product. A brand is a customer\u2019s perception about product, service, or company. Therefore the task of brand-building is to give customers experiences that help them perceive your product in favorable way. The proof of success is not the number of boxes you\u2019ve ticked, but the change in the way customers think about the category in which you\u2019re competing. You want customers to rank your brand as number one or two in your category, not as five or six.The experiences you design for customers might include the product itself, a series of messages about the product, and a certain way the product is packaged, sold, or delivered. You might build in features that delight customers enough to tell their friends or write positive reviews online. You might also train front-line employees to represent the brand in a way that makes customers happy. You might design a program to encourage loyalty, rather than risk losing them to competitors. Beyond all this, you might want to imbue these elements with freshness and imagination, so your brand becomes a hard act to follow.A program with this level of complexity has more in common with writing music than baking a cake. If you try to address these elements one at a time, you\u2019re likely to end up with a \u201cFrankenbrand,\u201d a collage of experiences that customers perceive as mismatched and inorganic.A better process for designing a complex program is to address all the elements at once. Let the various parts influence each other dynamically as they emerge from your mind or your pencil or your team\u2019s whiteboard markers. Let them crash into each other and create new elements. Keep them in a liquid state long enough to see them morph and mutate into surprising new possibilities. Stir them until they blend into seamless whole, one that\u2019s more than the sum of its parts.When employed by teams, this free-for-all process is known as \u201cswarming.\u201d It\u2019s fast-paced, exhilarating, and well-suited to small teams of creative professionals. It\u2019s also disconcertingly chaotic. Swarming is not for the faint of heart.", "Work to an appropriate structure": "Every design has its own order. The job of the genius is to discover it. The best approach is to start with a logical structure, then deviate from it according to your needs, your skills, and the particular demands of your project.If you\u2019re designing your own house, for example, the combination of site, neighbourhood, budget, space requirements, and your personal taste may suggest a three-level, Modernist cliff-hugger to take advantage of the views and adapt to its special engineering needs. Or it may lead you to a farmhouse-like compound that blends into its setting and accommodate a range of specific uses. Every set of circumstances points to a different underlying order.If you\u2019re developing a website, parameters may include your skillset, your audience, their experience level, the navigational possibilities, your brand\u2019s personality, and the functional purpose of the website may point to magazine-style format with rich, emotion-laden photography. Or it may suggest an all-typography format with no-nonsense navigation and clear copywriting. Avoid cookie-cutter approaches. Every design should align with its unique purpose.This doesn\u2019t mean that every project should be produced lavishly, or that it should break the mold on general principle, but simply that each project has a hidden structure that, if discovered, can bring out its full potential. When purpose and structure find the right fit, one plus one equals three.", "Express related elements in a similar manner": "The principle of grouping brings clarity to any design by signalling the purpose of each element. Related elements should look alike, and unrelated elements should look different.For example, the designer of a smartphone app can create a similar look for each of its functional icons, expressing that these functions are of the same type or have the same level of navigational importance.The leader of an organization can direct the actions of employees by grouping her expectations into a long-term purpose, a medium-term mission, and a series of short-term goals, so every employee knows what do, and when.The writer of an instruction manual can indicate various levels of information by grouping the instructions according to steps, diagrams, captions, cautions, and tips. The steps can be numbered, the diagrams drawn in blue, the captions shown as italics, the cautions displayed in boxes, and tips marked with stars.The goal of grouping is to simplify understanding so that the user\u2014or the employee, the reader, the listener, the viewer, the follower, the citizen\u2014can interact with a design intuitively instead of having to interpret the wishes of the designer. In other words, the designer should do the hard work to make the user\u2019s work easy.By the same token, you should express unrelated elements in a different manner. If the dashboard in your car featured a large panel of look-alike buttons\u2014five for the windshield wipers, twelve for the radio, two for the headlights, seven for the air conditioner, and so on\u2014you would find these difficult to use without consulting the manual every time. But when each of these functions is placed into different groupings, they quickly become intuitive.There\u2019s a reason supermarkets shelve their items by aisles. With over 20,000 products, shoppers would find the store hard to navigate if all the boxed products were shelved together simply to make the aisles look neat. We tend to categorize grocery products by their use, not by their container types. The ketchup is next to the capers because both are condiments. The walnuts are next to the flour because both are baking ingredients.Organizing, designing, and leading all benefit from high degree of clarity. The way you group things can determine how they\u2019re understood.", "Match form to function, function to form": "Form doesn\u2019t always follow function. Sometimes it works the other way around. The rule is simply this: form and function should be inseparable. When the shape of something matches its intended purpose, the marriage seems inevitable, as if no other combination could exist. This is the rightness component of beauty, the quality that sends clear signals of authenticity, integrity, honesty, and wholeness.Reflect on the inevitability of a hammer, with its sculpted metal head and curved claw, and a handle shaped to your hand. Or the strong, angled strokes of an uppercase A, immediately recognizable as the first letter of the Roman alphabet. Or consider the intuitive gestures of a touchscreen interface that lets you scroll, swipe, click, or rotate. Think about the design of a business in which customers, employees, owners, and suppliers all get something they want, and are happy to give something valuable in return. These are examples of form and function in perfect alignment.Put yourself at the mercy of your material. Feel its desire. Spin the wheel of your imagination until the ball stops on the right answer. When you find the match, you\u2019ll feel a tiny thrill of satisfaction. Tune your sensitivity to this feeling, and learn to be dissatisfied until you find it.This is not to say that a genius would never consciously mismatch form and function. But even in this case, the mismatched pair would be a good match if it fulfilled its purpose. Remember, rule number one is to break the rules.", "Don't be boring": "The most common killer of a great idea is dull execution. Boredom interferes with understanding. It lets the mind wander as it searches for something to care about. It fails to engage the emotions of the audience, turning their experience into a tedious intellectual exercise.The antidote to boredom, unsurprisingly, is surprise. The element of surprise is the most powerful weapon in the creative arsenal. It confounds our expectations and rivets our attention. It makes competing stimuli fade into the background as we focus on what suddenly seems important.Surprise can take the form of drama, shock, wit, or even extreme beauty. It can simply take the form of contrast: dark vs. light, big vs. small, fast vs. slow, simple vs. complicated, and so on. It begins with a perceptual event\u2014we notice something different\u2014which then triggers an emotion. If the emotion is strong enough, we may store it as a memory and assign a meaning to it.Some examples of creative surprise:The punch line at the end a joke\nA burst of sweetness in a savoury dish\nAn invention that disrupts an industry\nAn optical illusion\nA fancy word in a plain sentence\nA quiet movie interrupted by a gunshot\nThe extreme simplicity of e = mc2\nA modern lamp in an ancient room\nA flashback in a fast-paced novel\nA tender ballad sung in a rough voice\nA sudden outburst of obscenities\nA huge sculpture of a small object\nSelf-deprecating humor\nA frozen moment in a dance routine\nAn staid product with a new feature\nA brutally truthful observationOf course, if you overuse the element of surprise, it\u2019s no longer surprising. It becomes the very background noise you had hoped to overcome. Surprise is your secret weapon. Use it strategically.", "Put the surprise where you want the attention": "The rule for surprise is this: Direct the most attention to the most important part of your idea. Don\u2019t sprinkle surprise around randomly, or the result will be scattered attention and a loss of focus.Some examples of focusing surprise:You write a particularly catchy musical sequence for a pop song. You make sure the most important lyrics are contained in that sequence.\nYou add an exciting new feature to a product. You make sure the feature underscores your brand\u2019s most compelling difference.\nYou design a trademark for a business. You make sure the strategic uniqueness of the business is reflected in its symbolism and form.\nYour movie script has an emotionally charged scene. You make sure the scene creates a turning point or encapsulates the main theme.\nYou make a slide presentation. You save your most compelling point for your most dramatic slide.\nYou write a headline for an ad. You place the most powerful word at the end of the sentence.While these examples may seem obvious, their lessons can be easily forgotten in the heat of creation. It\u2019s not too late to make changes after the first draft or the first pass. In fact, that\u2019s usually the best time to do it\u2014after you see what you\u2019ve got, and before you present it to others.", "Apply aesthetics deliberately": "Aesthetics is a collection of tools used to create and appreciate beauty, such as shape, rhythm, contrast, scale, colour and texture. Most creative people have a natural affinity for aesthetics, learning through experience the various tricks and techniques that produce the effects they\u2019re looking for. They often apply these techniques unconsciously, without ever using the word aesthetics.Other people would just as soon throw the whole notion of aesthetics out the window. They contend there are no universal laws for creating beauty, and anyone who says there are is not a true artist.But aesthetics is not a book of laws. It\u2019s more like a box of toys. When you play with these toys, applying them to your project in various ways, you\u2019ll find they can bring clarity, excitement, and nuance to your work. Some of the more universal ones are shown here.If these tools seem abstract to you, it\u2019s probably because you haven\u2019t felt their weight in your hands or applied them consciously to real tasks. With enough practice they\u2019ll begin to make sense and become powerful extensions of your creative skills. Aesthetic choices are never right or wrong, just better or worse. Try them and see.", "Visualize with sketches, models, or prototypes": "Our intuitive responses to new problems don\u2019t always work. When you move directly from knowing to doing something, you can easily find that your response is inadequate, off-target, or wrong. This is because what worked for one problem doesn\u2019t always work for another.But when you add the middle step of making, it changes not only what you know, but what you\u2019re likely to do. It\u2019s the imagination-based step of creating a range of hypotheses that you can prototype, test, and refine. The more ideas you can prototype, the more you\u2019ll learn about the possibilities of your problem. When ideas flow, the music of chance plays faster.Get your mind and hands working together. Make a sketch, construct a model, or assemble a prototype. Then another. And another. With each attempt, you\u2019ll reveal new possibilities for innovation. Your mind will talk to your hands, and your hands will talk to your mind. This dialog is called generative thinking, and it happens only when you\u2019re making something. It\u2019s the active ingredient of design.But what if you have no drawing skills? What if you\u2019re all thumbs? What if you couldn\u2019t build a sandwich, much less a prototype? You\u2019d be surprised at how little skill it takes to trigger new thoughts. While many challenges benefit from trained hands, other challenges need only the ability to draw stick figures, cut pieces of cardboard, or tape various objects together. The goal is to get the prototypes to talk back, surprise you, and make you think in new ways.Without prototyping your ideas, you can easily fall back into the know-do mode of problem-solving, unable to test whether your ideas will work in the real world. In theory there\u2019s no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is.", "Embrace messiness": "It\u2019s almost impossible to reconcile creativity with cleanliness. The sculptor gets metal dust all over his studio. The writer must wade through a clutter of notes, books, and crumpled drafts to get to her desk. The rock musician must weave through a tangle of cables, black boxes, guitar stands, and song notes to sit down and create. The business strategist must navigate a thicket of scribbles, arrows, and boxes on his whiteboard while avoiding the distractions of multi-coloured sticky notes on stacks of must-read articles.You may find that you can\u2019t be creative until you clean up your desk or tidy your workspace. This makes perfect psychological sense. Each new project needs a clean slate. And with each new project you\u2019ll need a little extra time to switch mental gears. But once the gears start turning and the project gets moving, the mess is part of the work. Don\u2019t worry about it. Don\u2019t try to clean it up until you need more space or you\u2019re ready to start a new project. Let the mess be a mess.Organizations that depend on innovation must embrace this reality. They should provide open, flowing spaces that accommodate clutter for extended periods time while their people do battle in the creative dragon pit. Clutter at this stage is not a vice, but a virtue: Messiness is next to godliness. Cleanliness can wait.", "Test your ideas in realistic situations": "Question: How can you predict whether an idea will survive in the real world? Answer: Test it in the real world. Many entrepreneurs believe you can\u2019t test new ideas. The reason they give is that people can\u2019t predict what they\u2019ll buy or endorse. While this is mostly true, what the entrepreneurs forget is that new ideas are tested all the time\u2014as soon as they reach the marketplace. At this point the shortcomings are apparent and it\u2019s too late to fix them.The solution to this seeming paradox is to expose ideas to the marketplace before they\u2019re launched. You can do this by approximating real- world encounters using prototypes and a small number of test subjects.For example, you can gauge the potency of brand messages by A/B testing them with a limited audience. You can assess the features of a new product by handing prototypes to a cross-section of likely users. You can try out a new business model by first opening a store in a small market. You can test the sales potential of a retail package by placing a range of mockups on a store shelf, then talking to customers who are shopping there.While none of these situations are perfect, they come close enough to real life to provide useful feedback. You don\u2019t need precise information to make a confident decision about a new idea. You just need uncertainty reduction. Without pretesting your ideas, you have only two options: 1) take a substantial risk and accept the consequences, or 2) reduce the risk by removing the qualities that made it innovative in the first place.Tip: Don\u2019t use focus groups to test new ideas. Focus groups were designed only to \u201cfocus\u201d the thinking of product developers and marketers. They weren\u2019t designed to predict future sales or to judge the market-worthiness of new ideas. Instead of focus groups, use your best creative judgment, build prototypes, and show them to customers, one at a time, in realistic situations.", "Simplify": "People tend to view simplicity and complexity as opposites. But this isn\u2019t strictly true. The enemy of simplicity isn\u2019t complexity, but disorder. And the enemy of complexity is also disorder. While complexity seeks order through addition, simplicity seeks it through subtraction.A goal of design is to drive out disorder by maximizing both simplicity and complexity. In most designed products, what we respond to best is a rich, layered experience (complexity) combined with ease of use, ease of understanding, or ease of purchase (simplicity).Most people have a built-in bias towards addition instead of subtraction. For some reason, the concept of \u201cmore\u201d comes naturally to us. Yet the innovator knows that the value of any design doesn\u2019t lie in how much is piled on, but how much is discarded. More is more, but less is better.Here are seven ways to simplify your work:Test elements by removing them one by one. A design should have no unnecessary parts or gratuitous elements. See if subtracting an element will hurt the overall design. If it doesn\u2019t, remove it.Discard needless features. More is not always better. Build your design around one or two main features and keep the others secondary.Kill vampire elements. Make sure none of the elements is contradicting a more important one, or drawing attention from the main idea.Place elements in a logical sequence. Try numbering the elements to give them a sense of order. Put them into a line, a series, or a time-based sequence.Group items into buckets. If the purpose of the design calls for a large number of elements, group them by use, meaning, size, or other organizing principle.Hide complexity behind a simple interface. Help people navigate complexity by giving them intuitive controls. For example, the electrical grid is complicated, but a light switch makes it easy to use.Align elements behind a single purpose. When all the elements support a simple purpose, the whole design will appear simple.Works of genius are rarely complicated on the surface. You can describe their greatness in a single sentence, and even embellish them slightly without destroying their simplicity. Such is the power of subtraction. As you learn to simplify, you\u2019ll discover that the best design tool is a long eraser with a pencil at one end.", "Learn how to learn": "Learning to learn is a metaskill\u2014a skill applied to itself. It multiplies your knowledge and accelerates your progress. When you learn to be your own teacher, you can acquire any skill you put your mind to. You can quickly build a new skill on the roof of the last one. You can move laterally from one skill to the next by bringing deeply understood principles to related disciplines. The ability to direct your learning is personal growth squared.Teaching yourself is called autodidacticism. It requires that you develop your own theory of learning, a personal framework for acquiring new knowledge. While every person\u2019s framework is different, here are ten principles you can use to construct it:Learn by doing. We learn better and faster when we use our hands, our senses, and our whole bodies in addition to our brains.Find worthy work. Not all work is educational, important, or fun. Look for work you believe in. It\u2019s too hard to work with one hand holding your nose!Harness habits. The brain forms habits when routines are transferred from the rational level to the automatic level. They allow you to perform familiar tasks with little conscious effort, freeing up mental resources to for new challenges.Focus on your goals. It\u2019s easy to become distracted by shiny objects in your periphery. A genius learns to concentrate on a single task for an extended period of time.Cultivate your memory. While general knowledge is available online, your store of craft-specific knowledge needs to be ready at a moment\u2019s notice. Memorize it.Increase your sensitivity. A key trait of genius is the ability to make subtle distinctions among outcomes. Consciously identify the nuances that separate the truly great from the merely good.Stretch your boundaries. To keep growing, always aim slightly beyond your current abilities.Customize your metaskills. Intuition, emotional intelligence, critical thinking, imagination, and other high-level skills can make a big difference in how you learn. Focus on the metaskills that will drive your professional success.Feed your desire. When you want something so badly that you never give up, success eventually surrenders to you. Keep the fires of passion burning with books, articles, talks, and conferences.Scare yourself. Take on projects and responsibilities that lie outside your comfort zone. Look for workarounds to mitigate your fears. As any genius will tell you, fears faced are fears erased.", "Start with curiosity, not belief": "Ideology is toxic to learning. As soon as you begin to believe something, the spirit of inquiry dies. If you believe that climate change is unrelated to human activity, there\u2019s no reason to change your behavior. If you believe that new technology is always beneficial, there\u2019s no reason to question it. If you believe your company is the best in its industry, there\u2019s no reason to improve it. Belief is the surest way to stop imagination, innovation, and progress.There\u2019s an old adage: \u201cSeeing is believing.\u201d The assumption is that we find it difficult to accept anything as truth until we see the evidence for it. Yet it\u2019s far more likely that, for most of us, believing is seeing. Once we believe something, we\u2019re all too ready to see it as truth. Pyschologists call this phenomenon confirmation bias\u2014a tendency to block out inconvenient facts that happen to contradict our belief system.A key characteristic of the genius is a strong disbelief system. Instead of starting from belief, the genius starts from a position of curiosity, wonder, skepticism, or iconoclasm. The journey leads from the unknown to the known, and, with luck and perseverance, you\u2019ll discover new information along the way.The rule is simple: If you\u2019re looking for real knowledge, keep ideology at bay. Pretend you\u2019re an alien with no preconceptions about life on Earth. Lean on belief only when necessary. And even then, think of belief as a placeholder for knowledge\u2014not knowledge itself.", "Do your own projects": "Something happens when you work on challenges of your own choosing. Your mind becomes magnetized. It starts to attract little bits of information that can help you solve your problem or complete your project. While a magnetized mind can occur with any kind of challenge, the effect is strongest when the challenge rises from your own passion or your own sense of purpose.When you do your own projects, you give full play to four capabilities: 1) An abiding passion for discovery and innovation, 2) an ability to shape a large body of knowledge into a coherent system, 3) the skill to translate this system of knowledge into action, and 4) a capacity for deep concentration over an extended period of time.These are the traits of a genius. Everyone experiences some success in these areas during his or her life. What the genius does is to turn these traits into lifelong habits, which are then expressed as talent. Talent isn\u2019t something we have\u2014it\u2019s something we do. We develop our skills in the course of working on the kinds of projects, problems, and challenges that address our deepest interests.While you can\u2019t always bend your workplace to your will, you can look for small opportunities on the outside, or after hours, to practice your craft. These experiences, far more than the daily grind of given assignments, will help you reach your creative potential.", "Keep a hero file": "Students in creative disciplines sometimes worry that they might lose their personal style if they allow themselves to be influenced by teachers, practitioners, or other students. They reason that imitation is the enemy of innovation. They believe that if the unique talent they need isn\u2019t there already, it never will be.There\u2019s a kernel of truth to this. But only a kernel. Because the way we actually learn is by standing on the shoulders of others. We acquire skills by watching more advanced practitioners do their work, eventually growing strong enough to support the weight of newer practitioners.To develop a strong personal style, open yourself to the widest possible range of influences. Look closely at the work of practitioners, groups, and cultures you admire. Appreciate with felonious intent. When you see something you wish you had done, copy it, photograph it, tear it out, take notes on it; put it in a file, pin it to a board, tape it into a book, or keep it on a shelf. Your natural likes and dislikes will act as a filter, so that the examples you collect will begin to resemble your future style.Every time you start a new project, revisit your hero file and use the examples as benchmarks for quality. Don\u2019t quit working until you\u2019ve achieved something as good as one of items you admire.Of course, standing on the shoulders of giants is one thing. Clinging to their pant legs is another. Make sure you steal the principles that underlie their work and not the work itself. Outright copying teaches very little. Learning to extract and apply principles is the path to genius.", "Invest in your originality": "The ability to produce original work is a rare and valuable asset. It lies at the heart of innovation, strategic differentiation, and societal progress. It imparts a quality of \u201cnever-before-ness\u201d that can command attention, fill voids, and create wealth. By definition, you can\u2019t be original by copying an original. You have to start from a different place.Originality doesn\u2019t come from factual knowledge, nor does it come from the suppression of factual knowledge. Instead, it comes from the exposure of factual knowledge to the animating force of imagination. Imagination is the ability to conjure mental images, sensations, or concepts without perceiving them through the senses. Everyone is born with this ability, but the genius is a person who cultivates it, applies it, and invests in it. Imagination is a learnable skill.Depending on the quality of your knowledge and the level of your imagination, originality can fall into four quadrants: 1) ideas adapted from the same domain, 2) ideas adapted from a different domain, 3) ideas that are new to yourself, and 4) ideas that are new to the worldIf you have a little knowledge and a little imagination, you might be able to borrow an idea from a competitor and adapt it for your own purposes. While not truly original, it can nevertheless contain enough freshness to get the job done. You can always take comfort in Voltaire\u2019s claim that \u201coriginality is nothing more than judicious plagiarism.\u201dBut let\u2019s say you have a bit of experience, and your subject knowledge is fairly broad. By applying a small amount imagination to your larger knowledge base, you might be able to adapt an idea from a different domain\u2014another industry, discipline, or culture. In this case your originality would be of a higher order, less like plagiarism and more like appropriation.Or maybe you have much less knowledge, but a well-developed imagination. You might be able to invent an idea you\u2019ve never encountered before. Although others may have invented the same idea without your knowing it, the ability to imagine \u201cnew to you\u201d ideas is the first step towards being an original thinker.As you accrue more knowledge and you exercise your imagination with deliberate practice, \u201cnew to you\u201d can become \u201cnew to the world.\u201d At this point you\u2019ve seen enough to know what has and hasn\u2019t been done, and inventive enough to fill the gap with a surprising idea.Originality is more than judicious plagiarism. It\u2019s the ability to dream, to disassociate your thoughts from the linear and logical and end up someplace new. And like many skills that were once thought to be inborn, it must be learned.", "Learn strategically": "You can learn anything, but you can\u2019t learn everything. Be careful what you take into your brain-attic, since there\u2019s only so much room up there. Pick your subjects with a sense of purpose.For example, if your goal is to bring a cinematic quality to video games, you should stuff your brain with the history of film, graphic novels, and representational art. You should pay attention to dance, sports, and music. You should master the digital tools of your trade, and take a strong interest in emerging technology. While you can certainly take up dog training on the side, starting a whole second career in dental hygiene would probably slow your progress.It\u2019s a competitive world, and the best way to outrun your competitors is to outlearn them. This doesn\u2019t mean burning the midnight oil week after week, month after month, head buried in books or eyes glued to various screens. It\u2019s not about the quantity of your knowledge. It\u2019s about strategic alignment. Does your learning line up with your goals? Will it lead to fresh insights or deeper understanding? There\u2019s plenty of time to learn everything you need to know, as long as you learn strategically and not randomly.Over the long haul, how you learn is more important than what you learn. When you know how to learn, you start to use the most powerful meta-skill of all. It\u2019s the self-awareness that comes from observing what you think while you\u2019re thinking it. \u201cMetacognition\u201d tells you when and how to use a particular strategy to get the most useful knowledge, right when you need it. It saves time and energy, which you can then apply to more learning, which in turn saves more time and energy. Great for you, great for your dog.", "Shore up your weaknesses": "There are two contradictory schools of thought on developing skills. The first is to build on your strengths and forget about your weaknesses. The second is to strengthen your weaknesses until your report card is all As. Unfortunately, both schools of thought fail to nurture your inner genius.The truth is, brilliant people often start with a lopsided skill set. They fall in love with a subject or activity for which they have a special knack, then keep adding to their skills while letting other subjects or activities slide. This creates a canceling effect: they get good at what they love, but their lack of ability in other areas limits their success. Think of the engineer without the right people skills, or the entrepreneur who can\u2019t balance a checkbook.The remedy for lopsided brilliance is to simply shore up your deficiencies and not try to eliminate them. You don\u2019t need the skills of an orator to be a thought leader\u2014just original ideas and the courage to deliver them from a podium. You don\u2019t need the drawing skills of a Leonardo da Vinci to be a great painter\u2014just a grasp of aesthetics and a vision for the next big thing in art history. The idea is to neutralize your weaknesses so your strengths can operate unfettered.The concerns of a genius fall into three main areas: 1) originality (applied imagination), 2) craft (mastery of tools), and 3) efficiency (getting things done). If you\u2019re like many creative people, you\u2019re strong in only two of these areas. All you need to do is neutralize your weakness in the third. For example, if you\u2019re strong in originality and craft, prioritize speed. If you\u2019re strong in craft and efficiency, prioritize originality. If you\u2019re strong in efficiency and originality, prioritize craft. By shoring up your weakest area, your genius is free to soar.", "Spend long hours in the joy zone": "When your work contains an element of joy, you learn faster. This is called ludic learning, or learning by playing. What makes it so effective is the space it allows for positive emotions. Emotions drive attention, and attention drives learning. Physiologically, creative play releases endorphins, tiny molecules that put you in a good mood. When you\u2019re happy, you\u2019re more creative. When you\u2019re unhappy, you lose access to your intuition. Happiness and creativity are mutually supportive.How do you know when you\u2019re in the joy zone? When you lose track of time and all you can think about is the work itself. This doesn\u2019t mean that your task suddenly seems easy, or that you\u2019re aware of having fun, but that you\u2019re completely absorbed in your challenge. You\u2019re working in the Goldilocks channel: not too easy, not too hard\u2014just right. People in this state can learn new skills up to ten times as fast as those who are anxious (with a too-difficult task) and those who are bored (with a too-easy task). Long hours become short hours when your work is playful.It\u2019s generally acknowledged that creativity seems to happen \u201cout of time,\u201d as if the clock doesn\u2019t matter. What\u2019s less acknowledged is that creativity actually requires this condition to flourish. Creativity simply takes as long as it takes. The more you try to rush it, the less you achieve. The less you try to rush it, the more you achieve. You can\u2019t reasonably expect to have an epiphany by 11:45 or an innovation a week from Tuesday. But if you forget about the clock, you may well have an innovation a week from Tuesday, if not sooner.Creative learning assumes freedom\u2014the freedom to find the right balance between your personal ability and your challenges. You have to identify your strengths, discover the right medium in which to express them, and allow yourself the necessary time to experiment and push the limits of your understanding. Ludic learning is often the doorway to genius.", "Make educational mistakes": "In the realm of creativity, mistakes aren\u2019t mistakes. They\u2019re clues. Each one reveals a part of the mystery you\u2019re trying to solve.The fact is, if you already knew how to proceed with a project, you wouldn\u2019t need creativity. You could just follow the recipe, read the manual, or tick the boxes. Creativity is the discipline you use when you don\u2019t know the answers, when you\u2019re traveling to parts unknown. On this type of journey, missteps are actually steps. Every mistake brings you closer to the solution.But here\u2019s the catch: You have to make bold mistakes. Smart mistakes. New mistakes. Because if you only do what you\u2019ve always done, you\u2019ll only get what you\u2019ve already got. You have to try, fail, and learn. Then try something new, fail a different way, learn more.When you make a prototype, you\u2019re making a prediction\u2014a testable assumption that lets you see what works and what doesn\u2019t. This is not unlike the way your brain works. It continually makes predictions against reality while your dopamine cells keep score. Before your predictions can be right, they have to be wrong. A wrong prediction then becomes a \u201cwake-up call\u201d that your dopamine cells convert into an emotion, which is stored in your memory as knowledge. The stronger the emotion, the stronger the memory.One of the benefits of purposeful failure is a gain in resourcefulness. Often the most resourceful person is the one who has tried the most approaches, taken the most risks, failed the most times. The continuous process of trying, failing, and learning builds up a wide range of responses that can address a variety of problems.The lesson for innovators is this: Instead of fearing failure, embrace it. Fail big. Fail often. Keep trying. Remember that making anything begins by making mistakes.", "Seek instructive criticism": "When you\u2019re working in creative mode, you\u2019re more likely to be imaginative and intuitive. But you\u2019re also more likely to make logic errors. Switching back and forth between creative mode and critical mode is difficult, since it requires considerable mental and emotional effort. The best cure for logic blindness is to seek regular feedback from people who can critique your ideas instructively rather than constructively.It\u2019s your job to be constructive\u2014you\u2019re the maker. What you need from them is a clear view from the outside. Ideal critics are those who will:Listen to your idea, ask questions, and not react too quickly.Strive to judge your idea against your specific intent.Summarize your idea in a way that seems fair and even insightful.Identify any aspects of your idea that they agree with or appreciate.Finally, identify aspects that they question or find lacking.In the real world, however, the feedback you get may be reactive, subjective, negative, or less than insightful. Sometimes you\u2019ll find it possible to erase the doubts of naysayers with a slight modification to the work. Resist the temptation to argue. Try to understand your critic\u2019s position, do your best to act on any advice, and always express your gratitude. Even off-target feedback can be instructive if you approach it objectively. What doesn\u2019t kill your project can make it stronger.  ", "Fuel your passion": "Creativity doesn\u2019t respond to time management so much as passion management. Passion\u2014the deep excitement you feel about your subject, your project, your profession\u2014is the engine of creative genius. While you only get a certain amount of time in each day, you can expand your passion nearly without limit. You can pump it up, stretch it out, increase its intensity\u2014all with a bit of management.The key to passion is to treat it as a resource, like a savings account or a kitchen garden. If you want to maintain a bank account, you need to make deposits. If you want to keep a vegetable garden, you need to tend your plants. If you want to feed your passion, you need to invest in your projects, your learning, and your inspiration. The investment can come in the form of reading, seminars, workshops, internships, pro bono work, time off, or simply doing projects you love. The goal is to return to work refreshed and renewed.But where does passion come from? Do some people have more than others? Is the game somehow rigged? The best answer is that each of us is born with a certain capacity for it, and then we develop it according to our abilities and desires.You may be the kind of person that falls deeply in love with a subject overnight, but has trouble maintaining interest for more than a few months. Or maybe you\u2019re the opposite: a person who takes a long time to develop an interest, but then stays with it for decades. There are some people with so many interests they can\u2019t seem to focus on one, and others who grapple with periodic depression, unable to stay excited about anything at all.While everyone\u2019s situation is different, the principle is the same: Passion drives creativity. Fuel it, protect it, tend it, grow it. Manage it as the renewable resource it is.", "Develop an authentic style": "Everyone has a personal style of working, but not everyone has a \u201cgood style.\u201d Good style grows out of good taste\u2014an appreciation of the way aesthetic principles determine beauty. Think of your taste as an ability to recognize what\u2019s beautiful, and your style as the way you apply your taste. Personal style is unique by definition\u2014it responds to a variety of factors, including your goals, your profession, your training, your culture, your life experiences, and the quirks of your personality.But what about good taste? Is it personal or universal? Here we wade into muddy waters. When it comes to taste, it\u2019s impossible to separate the personal from the universal. Still, it may be helpful to think of good taste as a universal ideal, an understanding of aesthetics that crosses all boundaries by addressing our deeply human need for delight. Those who are trained in the principles of aesthetics are more likely to notice the presence of good taste wherever and however it occurs. A Ming vase is beautiful whether you\u2019re Chinese, German, Australian, or Icelandic. An J-class yacht would be as beautiful to a thirteenth-century peasant as a twenty-first century sailor.Those who are untrained may \u201cfeel\u201d the presence of good taste, but not necessarily recognize it as such. They\u2019re more likely to define good taste as only what\u2019s fashionable, lavish, elaborate, or expensive.Good taste is often none of these things. It\u2019s the knowledge of how aesthetics can make a designed object or outcome more of what it should be, and less of what it shouldn\u2019t. Furthermore, you can\u2019t buy good taste. You can only earn it through effort. Good taste, unlike beauty, is not in the eye of the beholder. It\u2019s universal.Good style, however, is particular to the person doing the work. Your personal style is different than my personal style.In developing an approach to work, resist the temptation to put on a style by adopting \u201cstylistic\u201d elements\u2014such as overusing jump cuts in a movie, or always wearing one red sock. Reject all mannerism, ornament, and affectation. The route to style runs straight through authenticity, simplicity, and directness.Now, here\u2019s a secret: A good personal style will mostly come from your limitations, not your strengths. It\u2019s the result of working around your shortcomings, using all the aesthetic skills you can muster. Since your limitations are unique to you, your style will also be unique. This is what people find most fascinating about stylish people. They\u2019re uniquely and delightfully themselves. We can look to Oscar Wilde for the best advice: \u201cBe yourself. Everyone else is taken.\u201d", "Practice": "All creativity contains an element of craft, a set of making skills that connects aesthetic judgment with creative tools. The musician needs to turn her instrument into an extension of her mind and body. The furniture designer needs to get a \u201cfeel\u201dfor his equipment and materials. The CEO needs to master a wide range of reports, metrics, and control mechanisms. The software engineer needs to make his development tools second nature. The writer needs to develop an \u201cear\u201dfor vocabulary, grammar, and punctuation. \u2003Without the skills of your craft, you might be able to come up with original ideas. But you\u2019d have difficulty making your ideas stick\u2014demonstrating, developing, testing, and sharing them. Skills bridge the gap between thinking and making. There are no skills without practice\u2014practice is the exercise gym of genius. \u2003But what kind of exercises do you need? It\u2019s obvious that a concert pianist will need to practice scales for many hours a week. It\u2019s not so obvious what an app designer should practice. The fact is, there are as many ways to practice as there are practitioners. It\u2019s up to you to decide what skills you\u2019ll need to build, and then what kind of exercises you\u2019ll use to build them. Whereas what to practice is specific to your craft and your goals, how to practice is universal. Here are seven tips for mastering the art of practice: ", "Overcommit to a mission": "Passion is a powerful thing. But it\u2019s not always strategic. We live in a society where competition creates winners and losers. Unless you apply your passion to a unique purpose, you\u2019re likely to be squeezed out by equally passionate competitors. It\u2019s a cruel world. But it doesn\u2019t have to be if you master \u201cnichemanship\u201d\u2014the art of dominating a specialty that\u2019s unavailable or uninteresting to others.None of us is born with a purpose, but nature has equipped us with goal-seeking minds that let us perform better in the context of one\u2014a sense that life means something. It\u2019s the belief that we matter, that we\u2019re making a positive contribution to society. The best way to make a contribution is to find the overlap between what you have to give and what the world needs. \u2003You may be passionate about acting, for example, but the theater doesn\u2019t need another actor. It has plenty of actors, and thousands more waiting in the wings. What the world needs is a remarkable actor. It needs an actor who is exceptionally good, exceptionally different, or special in some useful way. If you want to be an actor, you need to find out what the profession needs, then decide whether you alone can be the solution. If you can\u2019t, you may end up as one of thousands who compete away each other\u2019s chances for work. \u2003The fastest way to find your niche is to pay attention to what makes you different. This is counterintuitive for students and beginners who assume that what\u2019s different about them is what needs to be corrected. As you enter the workplace, it pays to find out which of your flaws might actually be features. The actor who loses key roles to charismatic competitors might prove highly successful in supporting roles. The family practice physician with a so-so bedside manner could end up as an exceptional medical researcher. The corporate manager who has trouble staying focused might be surprisingly effective as an entrepreneur. \u2003The best strategy is to choose a direction that lets you work with your whole heart instead of a divided heart. Overcommit to a mission that fits your interests, stretches your abilities, and gives you the potential to make a difference. If a thing isn\u2019t worth doing, it isn\u2019t worth doing well. Wholeheartedness confers a distinct advantage upon those who can offer it. It turns ordinary work into extraordinary work, and it opens the tiniest niche to a world of possibilities.", "Stay focused": "Creativity requires sustained focus. Whether you\u2019re working alone or in a group, you need the ability to pay attention. Paying attention is an apt phrase, because it costs something to focus. You pay the price in psychic energy. Most of us can focus on a difficult task for a few seconds or a few minutes, but it\u2019s real work to stay in the game much longer than that. Our minds tend to wander, looking for an escape. We can almost feel our brain squirming in its seat.Difficulty focusing isn\u2019t new, but our attention spans are getting shorter as the pace of life speeds up. This is the trap of today\u2019s \u201calways on\u201dculture. If we\u2019re always on\u2014dealing with distractions, interruptions, and just plain busy-ness\u2014then our creative brains are always off. We\u2019re left with partial thoughts, partial experiences, and partial understanding. \u2003This doesn\u2019t mean that you should avoid any activity that doesn\u2019t align with your mission. In fact, outside interests\u2014and downtime\u2014are just as critical to achieving your goals as direct interests. They serve to round out your skill set and reignite your passion. The point is that creativity takes concentration, the ability to stick with a problem long enough to get beyond shallow, multiple-choice answers. \u2003Leonardo da Vinci was the very model of focus. By all accounts he was a highly social creature\u2014dressing in the latest fashions, hobnobbing with royalty, attending and designing the most glittery social events\u2014but he would also disappear for weeks at a time, incommunicado, to pursue a line of questioning without interruption. With this discipline he produced a huge body of artwork and invention, plus an extensive series of notebooks that included as many as 100,000 drawings and 13,000 pages of handwritten text. You can\u2019t switch off the world. But you can lock it out temporarily while you work. You can carve out quiet time to think things through by yourself, so that when you return to the world you have something deep and whole to show for it. \u2003Working alone doesn\u2019t mean being lonely. It doesn\u2019t even mean being alone. But it does mean paying attention, listening to your own voice, and listening to the voices of others with sustained focus. Only when you\u2019ve mastered this habit can you hope to approach genius-hood.", "Follow through": "Creativity takes perseverance: A great idea is not a great idea if no one gets to experience it. What makes creativity especially difficult is that there are so many unknowns. So many judgment calls. So many doubts about the outcome. A genius is the person who can power through the doubts to cross the finish line. Only the strongest are able to bounce back from the false starts, the setbacks, the wrong turns, and the strident voices of naysayers. This puts the creative genius in the same class as the mountain climber, the triathlete, or the seeker of high office. Without perseverance, all you have is a plan, an intention. You can\u2019t win if you don\u2019t complete the race. \u2003There are several tricks for overcoming adversity on the long road to creative success: The vast majority of people give up before completing an ambitious personal project. By simply following through\u2014by persevering\u2014you may well find yourself among an elite group of innovators.", "Do good design": "What is good design? It\u2019s a question that has kept designers debating for decades. Usually it circles around questions of taste, fashion, or functionality. Whenever the conversation comes up, the \u201ceye of the beholder\u201dargument shuts it down. One person will say good design is design that \u201cworks,\u201dand another person will say what works depends on the individual user. At this point everyone nods and the conversation ends. But the question is never fully put to rest. There\u2019s a deeper and more satisfying answer. Good design does not depend as much on the eye of the beholder as it does on a combination of aesthetics and ethics: Good design exhibits virtues. What virtues? Timeless human virtues such as generosity, courage, diligence, honesty, substance, clarity, curiosity, thriftiness, and wit. By contrast, bad design is design that exhibits vices such as selfishness, fear, laziness, deceit, pettiness, confusion, apathy, wastefulness, and stupidity. In other words, we want the same things from design that we want from each other. When you combine ethics with aesthetics, you get good design. \n\u2003\nCan you have a generous brand? A courageous company? A diligent algorithm? An honest product? Of course you can. Just as you can have a selfish business, a fearful policy, a lazy service, or a deceitful ad campaign. Good design is always aimed at long-term, broad success, whereas bad design settles for short-term, narrowly defined success. If design is change, then good design is change that benefits the largest number of people over the longest period of time. Take responsibility for your work. Create positive outcomes that reach beyond the near and now. Practice good design. Be a genius.", "Build support methodically": "It\u2019s one thing to be brilliant. It\u2019s another to convince people around you that your brilliance is viable. Of course, you can\u2019t blame them for shying away from risk. They may understand that every big idea starts out crazy, but they also know that every crazy idea doesn\u2019t end up big. They\u2019ve seen what can happen when enthusiasm triumphs over caution. \n\u2003\nPicture this scene: You bring an ingenious plan to your boss and say, \u201cSit down, boss. I\u2019ve got a great new idea.\u201d You explain your plan in breathless detail. Your boss says, \u201cWell, that certainly is a new idea. Who else has done this?\u201d\u2003\n\u201cNo one\u201d you say. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it!\u201d\n\u201cHardly\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the danger of it. If we enact this plan, we could lose everything. Our business could disappear, we\u2019ll both be out of a job, and our company will be the laughingstock of the industry.\u201d\u2003What went wrong here? Simple. You made the na\u00efve assumption that your epiphany will be an epiphany to anyone else who hears about it. What you neglected to consider was that it took you weeks of thought, research, design, and redesign to arrive at your conclusion. In addition, you have years of experience and knowledge in your special discipline. Expecting your boss to \u201cget it\u201d without the same knowledge is unrealistic. Imagine being shown a map of the world, only upside down, and being told that this is how all maps will be displayed in the future. Even though you know it\u2019s the same map you\u2019ve seen a thousand times, it suddenly seems unfamiliar. It feels wrong. It takes a bit of effort to accept the idea that Australia is \u201cup over\u201dinstead of \u201cdown under.\u201d\u2003Now imagine being presented with an idea that\u2019s guaranteed to turn your actual world upside down. It could be a radical new business initiative, a sweeping organizational change, or an offer of relocation to another country. Your first reaction might be resistance. You might cast around for logical arguments against it. Your whole body might be urging fight or flight. \u2003A prerequisite for selling a new idea is to understand what geneticist J.B.S. Haldane knew when he charted the four stages of acceptance. Whenever a game-changing idea is presented, the first impulse of colleagues is to reject it as \u201cworthless nonsense.\u201d As it starts to get traction, the same colleagues label it \u201cinteresting, but perverse.\u201d Later, when the idea is all but proven, they admit that \u201cit\u2019s true, but unimportant.\u201d Finally, when success is assured, they claim \u201cI always said so.\u201d\u2003The trick is to condense the four stages into a shorter time span. If you can take your audience on the journey from \u201cworthless nonsense\u201d to \u201cI always said so\u201d in a matter of days instead of months, you may be able to keep the integrity of your idea as you gather broad support. The best way to condense the journey is with a story. The story can take the form of a fable, a comic strip, a children\u2019s book, or any other narrative vehicle. It can be illustrated with photos, drawings, charts, or videos. The main thing is to keep it simple. A deluge of facts will not win hearts and minds. \u2003When you lead people from what is to what could be with a simple story, they can more easily imagine themselves playing a role. And if you give them a clear illustration of the happily-ever-after moment, they\u2019ll carry it in their minds as they go forward. Where there\u2019s a way, there\u2019s often a will.", "Don't blame others": "Since the road to innovation is paved with mistakes, it\u2019s sometimes tempting to place the blame on others. Don\u2019t do it. Avoid pointing the finger, even when the problem is clearly not your fault. Take as much responsibility as you can. \u2003By the same token, when you\u2019re working in a group, don\u2019t offload responsibility to others by \u201cleaving the ball in their court.\u201d Try to keep the ball in your own court where you have control over it. And when you do send it over the net, follow it up to make sure it comes back. \u2003There\u2019s something empowering about taking responsibility. You can make sure things are done right while averting delays and misunderstandings.Let\u2019s look at two examples. In our first example, Jason works in a group tasked with reimagining the customer experience for his company. He asks his subordinate Mark to conduct some observational research that they could both present at the next group session. Three days before the meeting, he learns that Mark\u2019s research won\u2019t be ready. John, now facing a disappointed group, explains that Mark has been late with his materials. The leader of the group reluctantly replaces both John and Mark with another team. \u2003In our second example, at a broadcast company, Jennifer is working furiously to finalize a story for the evening news. Her computer crashes, erasing all her work. Earlier that day she had begged IT for help, but the technician never appeared. She calls her boss and sincerely apologizes for her embarrassing failure. Then she quickly locates an archived story to fill the scheduling hole, and sets about re-creating her story for a later program. A year later when her boss moves up to VP, Jennifer steps into her boss\u2019s role. \u2003A benefit of taking responsibility is that you place yourself in a position of strength. People will tend to see you as a leader. They\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt, and the freedom to set things right.", "Join a network": "You can be a genius all by yourself, but a genius without a community is not as powerful as a genius within a latticework of kindred spirits. As with any kind of lattice, whether physical, chemical, or social, it\u2019s the connections between the parts that determine the collective power of the whole\u2014and therefore its value to the parts. In a social network, how you connect is everything. \u2003There are two main ways to connect in a social network: bonding and bridging. Bonding is making friends with like-minded people\u2014people of the same profession, the same political party, the same religion, the same nationality, or the same age. Bridging is making friends with like-spirited people\u2014people from different backgrounds, but with similar ethics and ambition. Both kinds of connections are necessary to be successful and happy. But bridging is the activity that brings the highest rewards for innovators. \u2003If you\u2019re seeking new information or insights, you\u2019ll need to look beyond your clique, since a clique is a closed system that acts more like a mirror than a window. Open the window. Connect with groups outside your circle. Put yourself in the way of meeting like-spirited people and not only like-minded people. There\u2019s a popular saying that came from a Frank Sinatra song. It goes like this: If you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere. While this may be true in some cases, for people in creative roles and niche businesses the opposite is more likely to be true: If you can\u2019t make it anywhere else, you can probably make it in New York. Large populations provide the social and business networks that can nurture professional success, especially when the profession is highly specialized or the specialist has rarified skills. You can perform in musicals in the state of Nebraska, but you\u2019ll learn much faster on the stages of New York. \u2003Furthermore, studies show that people are happier in social networks. People near the center of a community tend to grow happier over time than those at the edges. This is because people in networks tend to share more knowledge. When you continually give away what you know, you learn to replenish your knowledge as you go, and you also benefit from the knowledge of others. Those who hoard knowledge don\u2019t get much knowledge back. \u2003Genius is not so much something you have as something you do. You can believe you have genius in private, but you can\u2019t prove it unless you exercise it in public. The facts are clear: Excellence thrives in a network.", "Become who you are": "The arc of human evolution is really the arc of human learning. Our biology keeps improving, but only at a snail\u2019s pace. Our culture evolves much, much faster. The average IQ has edged upward in the last 50 years, whereas our biological brains have hardly changed at all in the last 50,000 years. \u2003Most of us assume that learning difficult subjects requires a higher IQ, but it\u2019s more likely that a higher IQ comes from confronting difficult subjects. In a way, we don\u2019t solve problems\u2014problems solve us. They help us complete the puzzle of who we are, asking us to stretch beyond our boundaries and confront what we don\u2019t know. \u2003Genius, not evolution, is now the primary driver of progress. A genius is a person who takes creativity to the point of originality while creating better and more beautiful things\u2014tools, objects, experiences, relationships, situations, solutions, and ideas. If the outcome is not beautiful, the maker is not demonstrating genius but mere creativity. Genius works on a higher level. It strives for elegance, ethics, and a level of quality that comes from mastery. \u2003There\u2019s no set route to mastery. You can\u2019t print out a map or follow the instructions of your GPS device. The only voice that really matters is the voice in your head, the one telling you to leap on this opportunity, avoid that trap, wait and see on that situation. In the pursuit of mastery, as in the geometry of nature, there are no straight lines\u2014only curving, broken, sketchy, or tentative ones. The kind of learning that feeds your particular genius requires you take the scenic route, not the shortcut. \u2003That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re without resources. A hiker may not know what kind of weather lies ahead, or what kind of terrain to expect, but she can start out with a general plan, be prepared with a backup plan, pack the right equipment, and arm herself with survival skills. Every step or misstep is provisional and correctable, a mini-lesson on the path to genius. \u2003When you teach yourself, your learning is not part of a curriculum. There\u2019s no certificate, no graduation day. Just the satisfaction of following your joy until you become the person you\u2019re capable of being\u2014the kind of person who aspires not just to be yourself but to make more of yourself\u2014through learning, creativity, expression, influence, and love. You become the story you tell about yourself. Your story is your map. \u2003We\u2019re not human beings; we\u2019re human becomings. We\u2019re not the sum of our atoms; we\u2019re the potential of our spirit, our vision, and our talent. We delight in feeling alive, in seeing what\u2019s possible, in putting our mark on the universe.", "Make new rules": "The first rule of genius is to break the rules. The last rule is to replace them with your own rules\u2014 variations drawn from your own experience, aligned with your own style of working. Rules are not laws. They\u2019re guidelines, and, as such, they must be seen as provisional. All true invention, like all true art, is an act of protest, a rebellion against rules that have hardened into laws. Your job is to melt down the laws and recast them as principles that make sense to you, your discipline, and the needs of your work."}}, {"heading": "Principles of No UI", "link": "/collections/principles-of-no-ui", "author": "Golden Krishna", "sourcetext": "The Best Interface is No Interface", "sourceurl": "http://www.nointerface.com/", "detail": {"Embrace Typical Processes Instead of Screens": "Too often the gut reaction to solving a problem is to slap a screen based interface on it.

By stepping back from a one-device mindset, your company will start to see opportunities to play a part in the larger ecosystem.", "Embrace Diversity": "Ecological Root: Biodiversity\nUX Translation: Distribute functions selectivelyBiodiversity is life's way of reducing pressure on resources. Different organisms need different things. In the mobile ecosystem, attention is the limited resource. By creating diversity in how a particular service is delivered, companies open up different ways of capturing a user's attention. Each touchpoint has a familiar experience \u2014 a shared DNA \u2014 and yet each also has a different role to play. This screen is large, that screen is portable. This interface has access to a keyboard, that interface has a camera. This device is mine, that device belongs to everybody. Leverage the differences in positive ways. Think about the role each touchpoint plays in the overall journey of getting something done. A \u201cfamily\u201d of experiences is recognizable on any device, but can tackle a diversity of functions as a unit.Method: Distribute the parts of an experience across the user's journey. You may find that it helps to give each device a role \u2014 cheerleader, operator, concierge \u2014 just to make sure an experience is providing the best value for a given context. Use the roles as benchmarks in prioritizing which features go on which devices. Often, device personas uncover opportunities to support an action in places that hadn't been considered.", "Support Exchanges": "Ecological Root: Symbiosis and mutualism\nUX Translation: Support cooperation between servicesSymbiosis plays a large part in maintaining harmony within natural ecosystems. Processes like pollination, cultivation, and digestion happen as a result of mutually beneficial exchanges between organisms. If a mobile experience is going to create the same sort of harmony in a user's life, it should strive to play well with others.Method: Manage transitions between context and device. The various touchpoints of an experience should cooperate to keep users engaged. For example, if you're building a shopping list app, map the journey from the moment the list is created at home on a tablet to the moment the user completes the purchase at an in-store point-of-sale (and everything in between). See how your experience holds up when it is presented with scenarios where users might transition from one device to another, one social situation to another, and so on. How do the different parts of an experience interact? Once companies start thinking about what users are doing instead of what they're using, it becomes easier to maintain the flow of an experience.", "Ensure Resiliency": "Ecological Root: Equilibrium\nUX Translation: Maintain uninterrupted connectionIn the natural environment, life doesn't wait for the perfect conditions. Balance is maintained, even if resources change or there are shifts in population. Digital ecosystems have to be just as flexible to respond as conditions change. If devices or services are not available or are taken out of the equation, the user should still be able to achieve their goals. The same should be true if a network connection is intermittent or disrupted. When users move from service to service, switch from device to device, travel in and out of spaces, they shouldn't have to think about what they need to take with them.Method: Multi-device experiences must minimize the impact of change in technology, social dynamic, or connection. Mobile devices give users the freedom to live uninterrupted. Accommodate quick and easy switches. Service must be made resilient so that removing one component in the experience doesn't mean the whole ecosystem falls apart. Whether it means storing data in the cloud, caching important content, or designing a redundant app strategy, companies must do what they have to do so that users can still get things done.", "Integrate Naturally": "Ecological Root: Environmental sensitivity\nUX Translation: Integrate with other servicesNatural ecosystems have certain stable conditions \u2014 amount of precipitation, climate, raw materials, and so on \u2014 that allow the organisms within that ecosystem to thrive. Just as environmentally-friendly construction and building projects are sensitive to bringing in foreign materials that might disturb natural ecosystems, the builders of the digital ecosystem should first try to work with what is already available. To add value in the digital ecosystem, it comes down to behavior. Don't force people to juggle more devices and services when there might be a more intuitive, direct way of getting an activity done.\nMethod: First, evaluate the resources that are already available and leverage them as best as possible. No sense creating a new social networking tool or adding a screen when users aren't having any problems with what's already there. For example, bringing digital services into the kitchen doesn't necessarily mean building a screen into a table. The use of natural gestures and voice controls fit better into established kitchen behaviors. Too often, companies get distracted and solve \u201cproblems\u201d users weren't having. The idea is to fill an unmet need, a space where people and devices are not connecting as well as they can. Don't add to the already complex ecosystem until you've exhausted the possibilities. Remember, convergence is about making activities simpler, easier, and more effortless.", "Expect Evolution": "Ecological Root: Evolution and adaptation\nUX Translation: Iterate and create flexible designsOrganic organisms are programed with an instinct to survive. Even as the environment undergoes gradual changes, nature selects for traits are adapted to new conditions. Digital experiences are no different. As platforms constantly evolve and new devices connecting to the ecosystem, companies need a plan. One that is has a diversity of traits and is capable of responding to new challenges. Not just technological challenges. People, too, are changing. And creating a flexible, long-term experience is about adapting to what they are trying to accomplish. Remember, you're converging with people's lives, not their technologies.Method: Create a flexible framework of design principles and experience attributes that stay true throughout a series of efforts. Unified elements will keep diverse teams focused on the underlying value of what they are trying to build, instead of getting distracted by every release and update in the mobile landscape. With a framework, brands can think strategically about where the opportunities are greatest. Roadmaps can only see so far ahead. We've found it's best to have a vision for what lies three to five years out, and a more defined plan for the next 18 months. Have the discipline to prioritize, roll out regular releases, and listen to your users. Most importantly, at each juncture, don't just stick to the plan \u2014 stop and make sure the plan is still relevant."}}, {"heading": "The Ten Principles of Inclusive Web Design", "link": "/collections/the-ten-principles-of-inclusive-web-design", "author": "Sandi Wassmer", "sourcetext": "Sandi's Blog", "sourceurl": "http://sandiwassmer.co.uk/resources/the-ten-principles-of-inclusive-web-design/", "detail": {"Equitable": "Be welcoming, don't discriminate and engage with people.

Show, don\u2019t tell. Create a seamless transition from \u201ctry\u201d to \u201cbuy.\u201dDISCOVERYour brand is only as good as the user experience of your product. Messages should be consistent and integrated with your software\u2019s user interface. Showing the product\u2019s potential is more powerful than telling people about it, but the best outcome is when you do both simultaneously.One ideal discovery experience occurs when people feel they found the answer for themselves. Include users in the process by meeting them where they are instead of making them come to you.Think about your own shopping experiences: where did you \u201cdiscover\u201d? Instead of a product page, it might have started with a web search or in a forum such as Reddit or TechCrunch. Know your users like you know yourself and make it apparent that you understand their preferences and behaviors.TRYTrying out a product should be as engaging as taking a test drive in your first car. Because users compare your product to the competition, it\u2019s important to differentiate with an experience that keeps them wanting more. Remember, the most memorable experiences not only have measurable impact but also stir the soul.The best \u201ctry\u201d experience is one that shows, not tells. If your product is a large, complex system, a video of it in use, as opposed to a traditional marketing sheet, might be one enticing way you can \u201cshow.\u201dIf your offering is an online service, a powerful \u201ctry\u201d experience allows the explorer to actually use the service, with a built-in understanding that the user is in a \u201ctry\u201d context.The fundamental differences between \u201ctry\u201d and \u201cuse\u201d experiences online are the additional nurturing of the user who is exploring your offering and the sample data populating the service.BUYPurchasing a software-based product or digital service should be as simple and straightforward as buying a coffee. Steps and details about what goes where should always be obvious. Design a clear, convenient checkout process and let the user get started immediately. Give users a sense of excitement once their purchase is complete.", "Get Started": "Invite users in and show them what they can do.Initial experiences create lasting impressions. People are quick to form opinions when introduced to something new, especially if it is something we expect will improve their lives. Create thoughtful initial experiences to positively influence opinions of the product, service and brand. A careful attention to detail sets expectations for future interactions and forges enduring, emotional bonds between users and products. Good design of the initial experience can also result in reduced support costs, improved customer satisfaction and increased sales.Like any good party host, your product should greet users and give them a tour. Let people set their own pace by allowing them to skip any steps that slow them down. Provide users sample tasks in order to demonstrate the capabilities of your product in a safe and familiar place. Give users the option to watch a sample task being performed or to interact directly with the product.The best experiences seamlessly move a user into productivity with comfort and ease. Get users to their work fast and show them personally relevant ways to get value from your product. Charm them with unexpected moments to show them you thought of everything, just for them. Never underestimate the little things; users are instantly gratified when you save them time, attention, hassle or even space on their desk. Encourage users to experiment by showing them a focused idea of what they can learn and do.Like discovery, getting started often requires many stakeholders to deliver first business value. For cloud-delivered services, this might include the people who have to prepare user registrations or load data into a system. For on-premise products, this includes the people responsible for setting up and configuring systems. For both types of products, there might be tasks like integration with LDAP or other enterprise systems.First use isn\u2019t finished until personal or business value is delivered. First use is not satisfied simply by putting an overlay on the screen that shows where to click or touch.

Allow them to personalize the product to better fit their needs. Provide a forgiving environment where mistakes are easily reversible. Keep them motivated by ensuring that the right actions and tools are readily present. When they\u2019re done, give users a sense of accomplishment and help them feel proud of their work.As users move from novice to initiate to expert, their state of mind will change but the product they try, start and use everyday should be the same whenever possible.", "Manage and Upgrade": "Upkeep and receiving the newest improvements should be as elegant and predictable as using the product every day.MANAGEManagement tasks are often overlooked as a key experience for any software product. Besides everyday users, installers, system administrators and database administrators are all users too. These interactions should be designed to be clear and obvious for them and for the users whose actions they affect.A product that\u2019s easy to manage invites frequent use. A user who doesn\u2019t have to think deeply about managing how well a product works is a happy user. Whether it\u2019s an administrator who\u2019s responsible for an entire organization or an end user getting the job done, designing management tasks to be obvious makes for positive experiences. Remember, with either user group, the expectation is \u201cdon\u2019t trouble me with management.\u201dTo this end, management activities must be designed to provide clear system feedback and timely notifications of events, and to properly set expectations for mission-critical tasks. Scenarios to consider are: running the system, monitoring for issues, availability, user notifications, security, scalability.Management affects as-a-service offerings, not just on-premise offerings. The cost of maintaining an XaaS offering is directly affected by the investment in DevOps tooling. And with many XaaS offerings, there are integrations or data management requirements. People performing these services are users, and should be thoughtfully designed for.UPGRADEThe upgrade experience includes everything from large and infrequent \u201cversion upgrades\u201d to incremental updates of any size and frequency.Minimize user involvement and disruption in the upgrade process. Cloud-based products should deliver updates to users automatically. If users must be engaged to perform upgrade or update tasks, provide a well-crafted experience. Adequately set expectations of skill, effort levels and completion times. Prepare your users in advance for large-scale changes to their everyday use and workflow.When introducing significant user experience changes, don\u2019t leave your users guessing at what\u2019s new or what has been removed. Notify them that a change is happening or has happened, what occurred and how it affects them.Upgrades that require infrastructure modifications should be designed to minimize disruptions for the user. Data must migrate seamlessly and with perfect integrity. Downtime must be kept to a minimum.Even XaaS offerings have upgrade experiences. When there are interface changes to an XaaS offering, emails and other communications to your end users are appropriate and are a key part of their experience. Is your site going to be down for two hours? Your users need to be informed as a part of the experience. Non code-based interactions are often the ones that leave the worst taste in users\u2019 mouths. Think of all experiences holistically.", "Leverage and Extend": "Everything wants to be mashed up. Each part of your offering should be available as an API.LEVERAGEDevelopers amplify the value of your product any time they build new applications based on your product\u2019s capabilities and the data it manages. Make sure your application programming interfaces (APIs) and software developer kits (SDKs) are designed and well written. They should be informed by the most common use cases and be simple enough to start using quickly. Make common tasks easy and don\u2019t solve for edge cases at their expense. APIs must be documented cleanly and clearly. They should also be complete, with availability of all of the capabilities your users expect.Make it easy for your users to picture how discrete capabilities can be recombined. Keep the number of APIs you offer manageable to prevent option overload. When developers clearly understand the options that are available to them, they\u2019re freed up to get creative instead of guessing at what might be able to be developed.EXTENDWith the right extensibility mechanisms, developers can work wonders to \u201ccomplete\u201d your offering by extending its functionality, creating plug-ins and customizing it to better meet users\u2019 needs.Consider how third-party developers and customers might need to specialize your offering for a particular audience. Each developer audience has its own skills, expectations and ecosystems that we must design for. Design an experience that provides developers with efficient ways to extend the offering.The \u201cleverage and extend\u201d experience applies primarily to offerings with human interfaces.

When government services are designed to treat all residents with respect, empathy, and dignity, a transformative trust can be gained. 21st century governments:Begin projects by conducting research with real people to understand who they are, what they need, and how they behave.\nDesign processes, policy, and services around those needs, continuously returning to residents to get feedback.Example:\nIn Chicago, new civic apps undergo user research with residents from diverse racial, socioeconomic, and geographic backgrounds.", "Make it easy for everyone to participate": "Serving everyone means working with, not just for, a true cross-section of the community.

With limited resources to solve complex problems facing our communities, they should prioritize the work where they can have the most impact. By collaborating with others, they can make better services and save more money by focusing resources. 21st century governments:Develop relationships with outside partners working towards similar goals \u2014 like local universities, community groups, or other governments in their region \u2014 to share skills and resources.\nBuild on or borrow existing work when possible, rather than duplicating efforts.\nMake it easy for others to build on their work by offering data in easy to use formats with clear documentation.Example:\nIn Oakland, city officials and a community group collaborated to write answers to the questions that citizens searched for most frequently on the city website.", "Make data easy to find and use": "Open data helps make government better.

Governments who embrace approaches like analytics, data-informed performance management techniques, and predictive modelling can better meet residents' expectations, create new opportunities and improve overall efficiency. 21st century governments:\nUse data tools and analytics to get a more complete understanding of problems.\nStart with small solutions, test them with real people to gather more data, and make improvements based on what's learned.\nMake this data publicly available to drive transparency, community engagement, and accountability.Example:\nIn Louisville, departments use data analytics to identify inefficiencies in their work processes. Using this approach, they reduced unscheduled overtime and workers\u2019 compensation expenditures by more than $2 million.", "Choose the right technology for the job": "Over the last four years, Code for America has seen how modern technology tools and approaches helps government build trust with their communities and better address the challenges they face.

This is nothing but the transformation of government, with technology and new processes working together. 21st century governments:Work in an agile way, continuously improving existing processes.\nSupport new approaches to problem solving and delivery.\nInvest in staff to build skills at all levels of the organization, as well as hiring new talent where it\u2019s needed.\nAcknowledge and reward good work, including trying new approaches and attitudes to risk.\nBuild multidisciplinary teams focused on delivery.\nRecognize that the once a service has been delivered, continuous improvement of the service must be in place.Examples:\nIn Denver, department heads learn how to use Lean methods through the Peak Academy program. After four hours of training, one staff member was able to create $46,000 of annual savings in the Wastewater Division Department.\nIn New York City, the Mayor\u2019s Office of Data Analytics recruited fixed-term contractors with experience in statistics to improve the government\u2019s data analysis capability."}}, {"heading": "Six Universal IBM experiences", "link": "/collections/six-universal-ibm-experiences", "author": "IBM Design", "sourcetext": "IBM User experience guidelines", "sourceurl": "http://www.ibm.com/design/language/framework/experience.shtml", "detail": {"Discover, try and buy": "Meet users where they are.

Do not expect users to leave the current screen to search for and collect necessary information. Information must be in place and necessary tools present and visible.Anticipation requires that designer\u2019s have a deep understanding of both the task domain and the users in order to predict what will be needed. It also requires sufficient usability testing to ensure the goal has been met: If a tool or source for information is there on the screen, but users can\u2019t find it, it may as well not even be present.The penalty for failing to anticipate is often swift and permanent, particularly if you do not have a captive user, as is the case with public websites and apps, for example. Those users will probably never return from their search. Even if you do have a captive user, you probably don\u2019t have a captive client, and if the client\u2019s employees are wasting time trying to find required resources, your competitors will have a good story to tell when it is time to make their next pitch.", "Autonomy": "Give users some breathing room. Users learn quickly and gain a fast sense of mastery when they are placed \u201cin charge.\u201d Paradoxically, however, people do not feel free in the absence of all boundaries (Yallum, 1980). A little child will cry equally when confined in too small a space or left to wander in a large and empty warehouse. Adults, too, feel most comfortable in an environment that is neither confining nor infinite, an environment explorable, but not hazardous.Autonomy means users get to decide what keyboard they want to use, how they want their desktops to look (even if they like clutter), and what kind of apps they want to run. When developers take that kind of control away, users can be left frustrated and angry.Allowing users latitude does not mean developers should abandon all control. On the contrary, developers must exercise necessary control. Users should not be given so much rope they hang themselves. However, some developers today are not only taking excessive control, but making huge HCI errors in the process, like restricting text to fonts and sizes that people with ordinary eyesight can\u2019t read. They offer editing schemes that require the user to use their fat finger to place the text cursor with pixel-precision accuracy just to avoid adding the necessary arrow keys to their aesthetically perfect, but functionally crippled, keyboard.They also set an arbitrary timing and movement threshold for determining whether a user is or is not pressing a link on purpose, rather than her just pausing for an instant at the start of an upward swipe for scroll, for example. They then offer the user no way to alter that threshold, so many users find themselves triggering links to unwanted pages many, many times per day. That is an irresponsible application of control. We learned 30 years ago that users needed access to a slider for mouse double-clicking. Touch users need the same thing for link timing.No autonomy can exist in the absence of control, and control cannot be exerted in the absence of sufficient information. Status mechanisms are vital to supplying the information necessary for users to respond appropriately to changing conditions.Users should not have to seek out status information. Rather, they should be able to glance at their work environment and be able to gather at least a first approximation of state and workload.Status information can be up to date, yet inaccurate. At the time of this writing, when a user updated an iPhone or iPad to a new generation of system software, a progress indicator would appear showing that it will take approximately five minutes to complete the task. Actually, it typically takes an hour or more. (The new system itself would update in five minutes, but then all the other tens or hundreds of megabytes of information on the phone had to be re-uploaded.) The user, having been lied to, was left with no way to predict when she might actually get her device back. Such a user is not feeling autonomous.", "Color": "Most people have color displays nowadays. However, approximately 10% of human males, along with fewer than 1% of females, have some form of color blindness.Search Google for simulation tools. For example, for websites, you might try http://enably.com/chrometric/. For images, http://www.colblindor.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/.Color is a vital dimension of our limited communication abilities. Stripping away colors that a person who is color blind can\u2019t see does no more for that person than turning off the entire picture does for a person who is completely without sight. It\u2019s the presence of an alternate set of cues for that person that is important.Generating artificial obsolescence through fashion is a time-honored and effective way to move products from clothing to cars. A new fashion should not and need not, however, detract from user-performance. User test after making aesthetic changes, benchmarking the new design against the old. Ensure that learnability, satisfaction, and productivity have improved or at least stayed the same. If not, newly added aesthetics that are causing a problem need to be rethought.", "Consistency": "The following four consistency principles, taken together, offer the interaction designer tremendous latitude in the evolution of a product without seriously disrupting those areas of consistency most important to the user.The following list is ordered from those interface elements demanding the least faithful consistency effort to those demanding the most. (Many people assume that the order of items one through six should be exactly the reverse. This can lead to real confusion as users confront pages that look familiar, but act completely different.)Top level consistencyPlatform consistency: Be generally consistent with de jure & de facto standardsIn-house consistency: Maintain a general look & feel across your products/servicesCommunicates brand and makes adoption of your other products and services easier and fasterConsistency across a suite of products, e. g., Microsoft OfficeGeneral look & feel communicates familyThe overall look & feel of a single app, application or service\u2013splash screens, design elements, etc.A visual designer should establish a purposeful & well thought-through visual language, shaped by usability testing. User behaviors should be fully transferable throughout the product.Small visible structures, such as icons, symbols, buttons, scroll bars, etc.The appearance of such objects needs to be strictly controlled if people are not to spend half their time trying to figure out how to scroll or print. Their location is only just slightly less important than their appearance. Where it makes sense to standardize their location, do so.Invisible structuresInvisible structures refers to such invisible objects as Microsoft Word\u2019s clever little left border that has all kinds of magical properties, if you ever discover it is there. It may or may not appear in your version of Word. And if it doesn\u2019t, you\u2019ll never know for sure that it isn\u2019t really there, on account of it\u2019s invisible. That is exactly what is wrong with invisible objects and why, if you insist on using them, rigid consistency becomes so important.Apple apparently thought this was a good idea and started copying Microsoft by adding invisible controls from scroll bars to buttons everywhere. The situation on the Mac got so bad that, by the early 2010s, the only way a user could discover how to use many of the most fundamental features of the computer was to use Google to search for help. (For more, see: Discoverability)Some objects while, strictly speaking, visible, do not appear to be controls, so users, left to their own devices, might never discover their ability to be manipulated. If you absolutely insist on disguising a control, the secret rule should be crisp and clean, for example, \u201cyou can click and drag the edges of current Macintosh windows to resize them,\u201d not, \u201cYou can click and drag various things sometimes, but not other things other times, so just try a lot of stuff and see what happens.\u201dObjects that convey information, rather than being used to generate information, should rarely, if ever, be made invisible. Apple has violated this in making the scroll bars on the Macintosh invisible until a user passes over them.Interpretation of user behaviorChanging your interpretation of a user\u2019s habitual action is one of the the worst things you can do to a user. Shortcut keys must maintain their meanings. A learned gesture must be interpreted in the standard way. If the button that carries the user to the next page or screen has been located at the bottom right for the last 30 years, don\u2019t move it to the top right. Changes that require a user to unlearn a subconscious action and learn a new one are extremely frustrating to users. Users may not even realize what has happened and assume that something has failed in their hardware or software.If you want to attract existing users of someone else\u2019s product to your product, you should try to interpret your new user\u2019s commands in the same way by, for example, allowing them to reuse the same shortcut keys they\u2019ve grown used to.Make objects that act differently look different. For example, a trash can is an object into which a user may place trash and later pull it back out. If you want to skip the \u201cand pull it back out\u201d functionality, that\u2019s fine. Just make it look like an incinerator or shredder or anything other than a trash can.Make pages that have changed look changed. If someone encounters an unfamiliar page on an updated website or in a revised app, they know to look around and figure out what\u2019s different. In the absence of such a cue, they will attempt to use the page exactly as they have always done, and it won\u2019t work.If you come out with a completely re-worked area of your product or even a completely new product, it is important that people instantly recognize that something big has changed. Otherwise, they will jump into trying to use it exactly the way they always have and it just isn\u2019t going to work. \u201cUniformity\u201d would mean that your next product would be identical to your last, clearly wrong, but \u201cconsistency\u201d is little better in a field where so much growth will continue to take place. Our goal is continuity, where there is a thread that weaves through our various products and releases, guiding our users, but not tying us to the past.It doesn\u2019t matter how fine a logical argument you can put together for how something should work. If users expect it to work a different way, you will be facing an uphill and often unwinnable battle to change those expectations. If your way offers no clear advantage, go with what your users expect.", "Defaults": "When a user activates a field, the current entry should be auto-selected so that pressing Backspace/Delete or starting to type will eliminate the current entry. Users can click within the field to deselect the whole, dropping the text pointer exactly where the user has clicked. The select-on-entry rule is generally followed today. (Sloppy coding, however, has resulted in the text cursor dropping at various unpredictable locations. )Not everything should have a default. If there isn\u2019t a predictable winner, consider not offering any default. It takes precious cognitive cycles to look at a default that covers maybe 25% of the cases and make the decision not use it. That same time could be spent entering the choice actually desired.Users rarely have any idea of what \u201cDefault,\u201d in a given situation means. (They do know its literal meaning, of course, which is that the bank is going to take away the user\u2019s house. That always cheers them up.) Replace \u201cDefault\u201d with \u201cRevert to Standard Settings,\u201d \u201cUse Customary Settings,\u201d \u201cRestore Initial Settings,\u201d or some other more specific terminology describing what will actually happen. User test to find out what terms enable your users to accurately predict what your software will actually do.Make sure, through user testing, that users understand the extent of the restoration: Are they signing up to a benign restoration of just a few recent and localized items, or are they about to spend the next four days re-entering usernames and passwords in every app they own?User-test your restoration options to find out what users think the result of pressing the button will be. If you are going to do something benign, but they interpret it as potentially destructive, they won\u2019t use the option, leaving them with the same broken or partially broken system that made them consider using it in the first place. Likewise, if you wipe out hours of careful customization without properly preparing them, they may not be nearly as grateful as you might expect. (I once had a young chap in India help me out with a minor problem on my DVR. When he was finished, he had led me to reinitialize the hard disk, erasing every single program on the machine. That was a bit more restoration than I was looking for. After that, I was able to carry out the rest of my conversation with him without even using the phone. I had no idea I could yell that loud.)When designing tabbed objects, such as properties and preference windows, ensure that the visual design makes the scope of a restoration button clear. Individual tabbed \u201ccards\u201d should be visually separated from the surrounding window so that buttons may be placed either within the individual card or in the surrounding area, indicating whether the button action will apply only to the current tab or all tabs. There is never an excuse for leaving such a scope ambiguous. This is not a fashion decision.", "Discoverability": "Functional software does not have to look like a tractor; it can look like a Porsche. It cannot, however, look like a Porsche that\u2019s missing its steering wheel, brake, and accelerator pedal. Yet many tech companies in the late 1990s began purposely hiding their most basic controls, often to the serious detriment of their users. Why? Because they found it more important to generate the Illusion of Simplicity for potential buyers than to reveal the extent of complexity to their actual users.Businesses are driven to hide complexity from buyers because it can pay off in the short term: Most consumers who are potential buyers make judgements as to whether they can conquer a new machine not by sitting down and spending a day trying to learn it, but by gazing at the screen for ten minutes while the salesperson gives a demo. Stripping away scroll bars, hiding buttons, doing all the things that this section tells you not to do can all lead to increased profits, at least in the short term.You need never decide whether to support potential buyers or eventual users. We are not working with fixed pieces of hardware. We work with either pure software or hardware driven by software. A designer can easily create a system that will fully support both buyer and user, switching appearance depending on current need. You can design the software for an operating system, for example, that will present itself in a very simple form in the store only to slowly open up like a flower, offering the user more and more accessibility and functionality as the user becomes progressively more skilled and more comfortable.Crippling an interface might help make the initial sale, but in the long run, it can lead to having your most important \u201csales force,\u201d your existing customer base, not only leave you, but tell your potential buyers to stay away as well.Not all buyers are naive. Even those that are don\u2019t stay that way long. Only the most persistent buyers/users will travel the web searching for a treasure map to features that you choose to hide from them. Most will simply turn to your competitors, taking you at your word that you just don\u2019t offer whatever they were after.With Active Discovery, you cease waiting for people to find something and, instead, offer it to them. In its ideal form, your system \u201crealizes\u201d they now need it and offers it to them. In most instances, we are far from being able to do that. A workable compromise:The messaging might take the form of a \u201cDid you know\u2026\u201d hint that you show during startup. (If you see a large percentage of your users are turning off these hints, it reflects that you are prematurely mentioning features, are giving them too many hints too often, or continue to tell them about features they have adopted. It is not necessary to give a helpful hint each and every time the user starts up your app. They are more likely to be read and appreciated if they occur on occasion.The object itself should either be view or enclosed by an object or series of objects (documents within folders, menu items within a menu, for example) that, in turn, are visibly accessible at all times.Exceptions can be made for systems that are used habitually, such as a mobile browser or reader, where:These exceptions cover standard and widely-used operating system objects and behaviors on mobile devices, as long as users are given simple and obvious access to a help guide for using them.A few designers, having fallen in love with the clean lines of smartphone apps, thought it would be great to visit those same clean lines on giant-screen computers. Wrong! Hiding functionality to create the Illusion of Simplicity is an approach that saps user-efficiency and makes products an easy target for competitors.Smartphone and tablet controls are sometimes forced into the content area because the screens are so small, that\u2019s the only area there is. Even there, you need to provide a standard trigger, such as a tap in the middle of the content area, that will simultaneously expose all the icons and buttons representing all the hidden controls so that users don\u2019t have to carry out a treasure hunt.On laptop and desktop computers, controls, and, in particular, hidden controls have no place inside the content area.Include a help page that shows the gestures your app can understand. Present the page when the user first opens the app and make it clear where the user will find this help page after that. In a mobile app, make the icon representing the page constantly visible or have it form part of the standard set that appears around the periphery when the user touches the triggering area of the mobile screen. For a magazines and similar media objects, make it the first open page (after the cover) of each and every issue, always there and available.It is not 1980, when most people had never seen a computer, and we necessarily made everything highly visible. You can use subtly in design: Don\u2019t put an info icon next to every single item on the page. Instead, use overlays like this one from Google+ Snapseed that explain every symbol and every gesture at once:t is difficult to see with the overlay in place, but the developers have reinforced their Cancel and Apply arrows with permanent, written labels. How do you find out if such reinforcement is necessary? How do you find out whether the user can figure out what to press (in this case, an always-visible question mark at the extreme top right) to get help to begin with? Follow the next principle and apply the results.To discover what information you need to communicate and to ensure you\u2019re successfully communicating it, you must do routine usability tests throughout a project. Test using a population that has your expected level of experience with the system and task domain. See if they can locate, identify, learn, and use the tools they need to perform the tasks you expect your users to perform. If they cannot, iterate the design until they can. Make use of Active Discovery, Dealer Modes, whatever you need to to ensure your users can discover and learn the features of your product.Not one of the errors I\u2019ve discussed above would ever make it into production were user-experience groups conducting usability studies and altering the design based on those results.", "Efficiency of the User": "In judging the efficiency of a system, look beyond just the efficiency of the machine. People cost a lot more money than machines, and while it might appear that increasing machine productivity must result in increasing human productivity, the opposite is often true. As a single example, forcing customers to enter telephone numbers without normal spacing or punctuation saves a single line of code and a handful of machine cycles. It also results in a lot of incorrectly captured phone numbers as people cannot scan clusters of ten or more digits to discover errors. (That\u2019s exactly why phone numbers are broken up into smaller pieces.) The amount of time wasted by just one person in your company trying to track down the correct version of an incorrectly entered phone number would sweep away the few minutes it would have taken to code the entry form so users could scan and correct their errors. Wrong numbers also can and do result in a lost sales. How many trillions of machine cycles would the profit from a single lost sale have covered?Typically, the highest expense by far in a business is labor cost. Any time an employee must wait for the system to respond before they can proceed, money is being lost.Large organizations tend to be compartmentalized, with each group looking out for its own interests, sometimes to the detriment of the organization as a whole. Information technology departments often fall into the trap of creating or adopting systems that result in increased efficiency and lowered costs for the information resources department, but at the cost of lowered productivity for the company as a whole. It is your job to run the studies that prove out whether new designs based on new, money-saving technologies will increase or decrease overall productivity among the affected workers and, if so, by how much and with what result to the corporation\u2019s bottom line.Work with HR or department heads to find out the average cost per hour of affected employees. (An honored rule of thumb is to take their hourly wage and multiply it by three to include all the other overhead associated with an employee, from rent to heat, lights, computer support, etc.) Multiply the overhead cost x the number of affected employees x the time an activity takes x the difference in productivity, positive or negative, in carrying out the activity to find the actual cost of a change. A positive number will help you sell your group and your design. A negative number will help your company from making a costly mistake.This simple truth is why it is so important for everyone involved in a software project to appreciate the importance of making user productivity goal number one and to understand the vital difference between building an efficient system and empowering an efficient user. This truth is also key to the need for close and constant cooperation, communication, and conspiracy between engineers and human interface designers if this goal is to be achieved.Look at the difference between the iPad and the netbook computers it crushed. The differences had nothing to do with what key you pressed to open an email. They had to do with things like not having to press any key at all.Error messages must be written by a skilled writer to:\u201cError -1264\u2033 doesn\u2019t do any of these. Rare is the error message that covers even Point One well. Yours should cover all three. Your Quality Assurance group should be charged with the responsibility for reporting back to you any message that does not fulfill the criteria.Many other principles in this list affect efficiency, Latency Reduction and Readability in particular.", "Explorable Interfaces": "Mimic the safety, consistency, visibility, and predictability of the natural landscape we\u2019ve evolved to navigate successfully. Don\u2019t trap users into a single path through a service, but do offer them a line of least resistance. This lets the new user and the user who just wants to get the job done in the quickest way possible a \u201cno-brainer\u201d way through, while still enabling those who want to explore and play what-if a means to wander farther afield.The earlier your users are on the experience curve, the more you need to guide them. A single-use application for accomplishing an unknown task requires a far more directive interface than a habitual-use interface for experts. The deepest ruts are wizards.Stable visual elements not only enable people to navigate fast, they act as dependable landmarks, giving people a sense of \u201chome.\u201d A company logo on every page of a website, including every page of checkout, all enabling the user to escape back to the home page, makes users feel safe and secure. Paradoxically, such cues make it more likely that people will not escape back to the home page, secure in the knowledge that they easily can.People explore in ways beyond navigation. Sometimes they want to find out what would happen if they carried out some potentially dangerous action. Sometimes they don\u2019t intend to find out, but they do anyway by accident. By making actions reversible, users can both explore and can \u201cget sloppy\u201d with their work. A perfect user is a slow user.The unavoidable result of not supporting undo is that you must then support a bunch of confirmation dialogs that say the equivalent of, \u201cAre you really, really sure?\u201d Needless to say, this slows people down.If you fail to provide such dialogs, in the absence of undo, people slow down even further. A study a few years back showed that people in a hazardous environment make no more mistakes than people in a supportive and more visually obvious environment, but they work a lot slower, taking great care to avoid making errors. The result was a huge hit in productivity.We usually think of the absence of Undo as being the sign of lazy programming, but sometimes people do it on purpose. For example, some ecommerce sites want to make it hard for you to take things back out of your shopping cart once you\u2019ve put them in there. This turns out to be a backwards strategy: An ecommerce study we did at the Nielsen Norman Group looked at what happens when merchants make it really easy to take things out of shopping carts. As might be expected, people visiting these merchants were much more willing to throw things in, figuring, \u201coh, well, I can always take it back out later.\u201d Except they didn\u2019t take them back out, because the deletion rate was no different. These user just bought more stuff.Users should never feel trapped inside a maze. They should have a clear path out.", "Fitts's Law": "Use large objects for important functions (Big buttons are faster). Use small objects for functions you would prefer users not perform.Use the pinning actions of the sides, bottom, top, and corners of your display: A single-row toolbar with tool icons that \u201cbleed\u201d into the edges of the display will be significantly faster than a double row of icons with a carefully-applied one-pixel non-clickable edge between the closer tools and the side of the display. (Even a one-pixel boundary can result in a 20% to 30% slow-down for tools along the edge.)While at first glance, this law might seem patently obvious, it is one of the most ignored principles in design. Fitts\u2019s law (often improperly spelled \u201cFitts\u2019 Law\u201d) dictates the Macintosh pull-down menu acquisition should be approximately five times faster than Windows menu acquisition, and this is proven out.Fitts\u2019s law predicted that the Windows Start menu was built upside down, with the most used applications farthest from the entry point, and tests proved that out. Fitts\u2019s law indicated that the most quickly accessed targets on any computer display are the four corners of the screen, because of their pinning action, and yet, for years, they seemed to be avoided at all costs by designers.In attempting to \u201cFittsize\u201d a design, look to not only reduce distances and increase target sizes, but to reduce the total number of targets that must be acquired to carry out a given task. Remember that there are two classes of targets: Those found in the virtual world\u2014buttons, slides, menus, drag drop-off points, etc., and those in the physical world\u2014keyboards and the keys upon them, mice, physical locations on touch screens. All of these are targets.Fitts\u2019s Law was not repealed with the advent of smartphone or tablets. Paul Fitts, who first postulated the law in the 1940s, was working on aircraft cockpit design with physical controls, something much more akin to a touch interface rather than the indirect manipulation of a mouse. The pinning action of the sides and corners will be absent unless the screen itself is inset, but the distance to and size of the target continue to dictate acquisition times per Fitts\u2019s law just as always.Like so much in the field of human-computer interaction, you must do a timed usability study to test for Fitts\u2019s Law efficiency.", "Human Interface Objects": "Human-interface objects are separate and distinct from the objects found in object-oriented systems. Our objects include folders, documents, buttons, menus, and the trashcan. They appear within the user\u2019s environment and may or may not map directly to an object-oriented program\u2019s object. In fact, many early GUI\u2019s were built entirely in non-object-oriented environments.Human interface objects that can be seen are quite familiar in graphic user interfaces. Objects that are perceived by another sense such as hearing or touch are less familiar or are not necessarily recognized by us as being objects. Ring tones are auditory objects, for example, but we tend to just think of them as ring tones, without assigning any higher-level category to them.Buttons are pressed, sliders are dragged, etc.Dropping a document on a trash can does not delete it, it stores it in the trash can. Selecting \u201cEmpty Trash\u201d is necessary to actually delete it.If dropping a document on your delete-document icon will destroy it instantly and permanently, do not make it look like a trash can. People come with expectations about previously encountered objects. It\u2019s important not to confuse or water down such expectations. For example, if you use a trash can icon, but instantly destroy documents dropped into it, it broadens the rule for trash cans. Instead of the rule remaining: \u201cDropping a document on a trash can does not delete it. Rather, it stores it in the trash can. Selecting \u2018Empty Trash\u2019 is necessary to actually delete it,\u201d it will shift to, \u201cDropping a document on a trash can will destroy it either right now or sometime in the next six months to a year.\u201d That is not only confusing for your users, it is damaging to every other developer that uses the trash can icon in the proper way.", "Latency Reduction": "Latency can often be hidden from users through multi-tasking techniques, letting them continue with their work while transmission and computation take place in the background. Modern web browsers can pre-fetch data, reducing the dead time when the user reaches the end of a task and must wait for the next page to appear.Because the Internet is slow, people tend to press the same button repeatedly, causing things to be even slower.Eliminate any element of the application that is not helping. Be ruthless.The sluggish speed of the early web set users\u2019s expectations extremely low. (It also burst the Internet bubble when people realized they could get in their car and drive round-trip to the shopping center in less time than it took to \u201ctrick\u201d the website into selling them something.) They have become less forgiving as time has passed.Mobile, which has an architecture more in keeping with traditional GUI applications than web browsing, has been reminding people that computers can be fast, and they are even more impatient with slow-downs. Wearables will come with an even higher level of expectation: No one waits to see what time it is, and they will not wait to see who is calling, what the temperature is outside, or any other information to be displayed.Automotive applications today are oftentimes sluggish, suffering from a fatal cocktail of weak hardware, poor design/coding practices, and high latency. Consider the car hurtling down the road at 88 feet per second (27 meters per second) while the user, eyes fixed on the flat panel display, waits to learn which of ACDC\u2019s many fine works he\u2019s currently enjoying. Imagine the rich irony when the accident report reveals it was \u201cHighway to Hell.\u201d", "Learnability": "Ideally, products would have no learning curve: Users would walk up to them for the very first time and achieve instant mastery. In practice, however, all applications and services, no matter how simple, will display a learning curve.Learnability and usability are not mutually exclusive. First, decide which is the most important; then attack both with vigor. Ease of learning automatically coming at the expense of ease of use is a myth.How do you decide whether learnability or usability is most important? The first thing you must do is identify frequency of use: Are you working on a product or service that will be used only once or infrequently, or is it one that will be used habitually? If it\u2019s single-use, the answer is clear: Learnability. If someone will use this every day, eight hours a day for the rest of his or her life, the answer is equally clear: Usability.Next, who is the buyer? If the person who will use it habitually will also make the buying decision, a product\u2019s reputation for learnability may be a key factor in making the sale. That\u2019s why you want to identify the most important of the two, then attack both.Much usability testing involves running a series of tests at regular intervals with your spending only 20 minutes to an hour with each subject you recruit. You end up knowing everything about the initial learning curve and nothing about either the long-term curve or the end-state level of productivity.If you are working on an application that will be used habitually, go about it entirely differently: Work with HR to hire temporary workers. Then, have them spend a week or two coming up to speed on the interface, monitoring them with time tests to see what the overall learning curve and the eventual efficiency of your interface actually prove out to be.", "Metaphors, Use of": "Good metaphors generate in the users\u2019 minds a strong series of connections to past experiences from the real world or from a previous cyberspace encounter, enabling users to form a fast and accurate sense of your system\u2019s capabilities and limitations.Try making your concepts visually apparent in the software itself. If that proves impractical, make it visual apparent through an illustration. The illustration should be compact and meaningful. Test it to see if it works, then embed it in such a way that every user that needs to see it will see it.Most metaphors evoke the familiar, but can and usually should add a new twist. For example, an electronic newspaper might bear a strong resemblance to a traditional paper, but with hyperlinks than enable users to quickly dive as far into articles as their interest drives them, something quite impossible with their paper counterparts. Not only is there no need to slavishly copy a real-world object (skeuomorphism), but unnecessarily limiting the functionality of a software counterpart just to \u201cperfect\u201d the imitation is most often bad design.The inverse of skeuomorphism is abstraction, a prominent feature in so-called flat design, a fashion that took hold in 2013, turning once well-understood icons and other elements into meaningless abstractions and even false symbols. (For example, the icon for the browser on the iPhone became a compass, only connected to the concept of the web through the vaguest of abstractions. The iPhone has an actual compass, so they turned its icon into\u2026 another compass! Two compass icons: One tells you which way is north and the other connects you to your bank account. The Settings icon had originally looked like the inner workings of a clock, clearly carrying the message that this is an app that will let you see and affect the inside workings of the iPhone. That was abstracted to the point that it looks exactly like a large industrial fan.)A metaphor is intended to empower your user. However, there are times when it can also hold back your design.", "Protect Users' Work": "This principle is all but absolute. Users should not lose their work as a result of error on their part, the vagaries of Internet transmission, or any other reason other than the completely unavoidable, such as sudden loss of power to a client computer without proper power protection. We\u2019ve gotten so used to being the victim of data loss that we often don\u2019t even notice it. So consider if what happens routinely on the web happened in real life:You go into Harrod\u2019s Department Store in London. After making your selections, you are asked to fill out a four-page form. A gentleman looks the form over, then points to the bottom of Page 3 at your phone number. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d he says, \u201cLook there. See how you used spaces in your phone number?\u201d When you nod, he continues, \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting you to do that,\u201d at which point, he picks up the four-page form and rips it to shreds before handing you a new, blank form.Of course, never in a thousand years would such an event take place at Harrod\u2019s, but another venerated British institution did exactly that to me almost twenty years into the miracle of the world wide web when I was invited to give them my emergency contact information for an upcoming flight into London. Every time I would fill out all eight fields on the form, it would come back with an error message about at least one field, having destroyed the entire contents of all eight of them! I\u2019m sure it was carrying out this wanton destruction for my own good, but I could not for the life of me figure out from the messages what it actually wanted. 20 minutes and two browsers later, I gave up. I\u2019m sure other passengers are abandoning their effort far earlier.Travel sites, in general, think nothing of repeatedly tossing all the information the user has entered about cities, times, days of travel, frequent flyer numbers, anything that takes time and trouble to type in. The user may attempt nothing more radical than leaving a half hour later, but that is apparently grounds to destroy their choice of departure city and date as well as arrival city and date. If the user is impolite enough to go to the bathroom, well, that sort of activity poses a significant security risk, so of course their entire evening\u2019s work must be destroyed, with a message explaining its been done for their own good.Travel sites may be the tip of the iceberg, but websites in general, are notorious for their cavalier attitude when it comes to their user\u2019s hard work, and it doesn\u2019t stop there: Traditional applications continue to crash and burn, and the excuses for entire computer systems crashing and burning are at an end. Small portables can survive a power outage. It\u2019s no longer acceptable that many of today\u2019s high-end desktop computers and operating systems still do not support and encourage continuous-save. That, coupled with a small amount of power-protected memory, could eliminate the embarrassment of $5000 machines offering less reliability than 10-cent toys.", "Readability": "Favor black text on white or pale yellow backgrounds. Avoid gray backgrounds.You must demand of your marketing people that they tell you what the expected range of your customer\u2019s standard displays will be. You then need to work with your graphic design and engineering people to ensure that your code will show up in appropriate sizes across that range of displays. It need not be one-size-fits-all. For example, CSS can mold itself to the system in which it finds itself.For example, the label, \u201cLast Name,\u201d can afford to be somewhat small. Habitual users will learn that that two-word gray blob says \u201cLast Name.\u201d Even new users, based on the context of the form on which it appears, will have a pretty good guess that it says \u201cLast Name.\u201d The actual last name entered/displayed, however, must be clearly readable. This becomes even more important for numbers. Human languages are highly redundant, enabling people to \u201cheal\u201d garbled messages. Numbers, however, unless they follow a very strict protocol, have no redundancy, so people need the ability to examine and comprehend every single character.Experienced users read only as much of an item name to differentiate among items. Highly experienced users actually trigger on the difference in the external shapes of the entire first word(s) without ever actually reading anything.Presbyopia, the condition of hardened, less flexible lenses, coupled with reduced light transmission into the eye, affects most people over age 45. Do not trust your young eyes to make size and contrast decisions. You cannot.Specifically, anti-aliasing softens the edges of a font, giving it a much smoother appearance on the digital page. The problem is that the human vision system responds to sharp edges, so, in smaller font sizes, an anti-aliased font, while often appearing more attractive, can be quite difficult to comprehend.There are anti-alias techniques that specifically increase the sharpness of the edges the eye is seeking, so this is not strictly a black and white issue (so to speak), but it is definitely something of which you should be aware and not something in which every graphic designer has been schooled. You will want to run some reading speed and comprehension tests on proposed font changes.", "Simplicity": "As designers, we need to strive to simplify users\u2019 lives. That often requires a delicate balance between our effort to make installation of a product easier and making subsequent use of that product easier or better.Consider the autofill feature for browsers: The user is required to enter and maintain a database of information the browser can then drop into a form at the user\u2019s command. It takes time to set it up, and every time anything changes, it\u2019s just one more record that has to be altered. What\u2019s more, it often fails to work, either not responding or putting incorrect data all over the place.Apple has simplified the setup process by enabling the user to link Safari\u2019s autoFill to the user\u2019s contact card in his or her address book. However, the ability of Safari to actually fill out a form is just as dismal as it\u2019s ever been, largely because there is no standardization of labels, locations, or anything else in forms.I have solved the autoFill problem with a more technically complex solution: I use an app called Keyboard Maestro that sits in the background looking for certain key combinations. When it finds one I\u2019ve programmed, it automatically replaces the text I\u2019ve typed with a string of text I\u2019ve previously stored. Setup was definitely more difficult, but now when I open a form and a field calls for my first name, I type, \u201cbbbb\u201d and it\u2019s replaced with \u201cBruce.\u201d I type \u201caaaa\u201d and my address appears, \u201cpppp\u201d and my phone number pops into place, etc. It takes me 30 seconds to fill out a form, longer than autoFill would if it actually worked, but this method works on every single form every single time. It saves me time, effort, and frustration.Often, you can assume that one user in the house will be technically inclined. When you have a trade-off between simplicity of installation/set-up and ease-of-use, get together with your marketing people. If they tell you that you can depend on at least one reasonably clever or sophisticated user, do make life a bit more difficult at first if it will make subsequent use a lot simpler for everyone else. However, expend effort making both installation and operation as simple as possible. That\u2019s the approach that Nest took, where one person in the house must go through a complex and confusing process to tie their products to the Internet, but thereafter the lives of everyone in the house become simper.(In Nest\u2019s defense, they are doing their best to overcome a major flaw in the way Wi-Fi set up to work. It requires users to leave their normal Wi-Fi and log in to a new \u201cnetwork\u201d with a gobbledygook name which is, in fact, their Nest device. This is a weird, backwards activity that throws most users the first time they encounter it. It also requires their going into the \u201cbasement area\u201d of their phone or tablet, a place most users avoid whenever possible. It\u2019s all-around bad, and the committees that oversee the Wi-Fi protocol need to address the issue if connected devices are to take off on an expanded basis.)In the early years of this century, Apple became so focused on generating the illusion of simplicity for the potential buyer that they began seriously eroding the productivity of their products. They thought they had a good reason: They wanted new products to look bright, shiny, and simple to potential users. That\u2019s an excellent goal, but actual simplicity is achieved by simplifying things, not by hiding complexity. (See Visibility.)It\u2019s just fine to make your showroom products look simple, but, to the extent you want to hide complexity to avoid scaring away buyers, do so in the showroom, not in the home or office of the purchaser now trying to accomplish real work. I started putting a special Dealer Mode into Apple software in 1978, so that the product would look and act differently in the showroom than in the buyer\u2019s home. Computers allow that. Somewhere along the line, people forgot.It is OK to make the user\u2019s environment simpler when they are learning by hiding more advanced pathways and capabilities, revealing them when users come to need them and know how to handle them. This is distinct from the illusion of simplicity, where necessary controls are made invisible or hidden in obscure and unusual places so that users have to go on treasure hunts to find the tools they need to use right now.Progressive revelation can cut down on support costs by eliminating calls from users trying to understand advanced capabilities before they have learned enough about the task domain to need them. It can also raise costs if advanced features are not introduced when they are needed or are too well hidden.This became another Apple problem after the release of their mobile devices. In 2014 on a Mac, you can set an alarm that will trigger 90 minutes before a calendar event. On the iPad, you can set a trigger for either one hour or two, but not 90 minutes. If a person needs a warning 90 minutes before the event, that\u2019s when they need the warning. Apple has \u201csimplified\u201d the interface by giving the user no way to set an arbitrary time. No weakness or defect in the underlying interface would prevent Apple from giving users this capability. It is a conscious decision to limit what people can do with the product.The way you set a 90 minute warning on an iPad is to create a second event, 30 minutes before the real event, and set a 60 minute warning.How is that simpler?Likewise, they have a very simple interface for finding photographs in your collection: You look through all your folders of photographs, one at a time, until you find the picture you\u2019re looking for. Apple will neither display nor allow you to sort/search on the title, caption, or keywords you\u2019ve carefully associated with your images. One can argue that the interface is simple: If you want to find a specific photo among that 20,000 on your iDevice, just look through your 73 folders you\u2019ve created in iPhoto or Aperture to hold them until you find it. You don\u2019t have to learn about searching, you don\u2019t have to remember the name, you just have to have 10 to 20 minutes on your hands to spend the time looking.How is that simple?Fortunately, after many years, help is at hand: Apps like Photo Shack HD (the HD is important) enable you to search on all the criteria that Apple is importing but refusing to show you. That\u2019s OK for really advanced features. However a remarkably high percentage (100% to be exact) know how to search.", "State: Track it": "Our systems should \u201cknow\u201d:and myriad other details. In addition to simply knowing where our users have been, we can also make good use of what they\u2019ve done.One site with which you are familiar is so involved in and good at tracking state that it could be described as a state-tracking system that happens to do other stuff. That site is amazon.com. Their uncanny ability to make suggestions on what we might want to explore and buy is the result of their understanding our full history on their site. They know what expensive items we\u2019ve come back to repeatedly in the past, what we\u2019ve lingered over recently, and what would go well with what we just or recently purchased based on like-minded individuals.Users should be able to log off at work, go home, and take up exactly where they left off. Following the principle of Protect Users\u2019 Work, whatever they were last working on should be preserved in its current condition.A private service for doctors, Physicians On Line, does an excellent job with this. Doctors can be 95% of the way through a complex transaction, log off, log in again six weeks later from another part of the world, and the service will ask them if they want to be taken right back to where they were.\u201cTrack State\u201d came late to this list, in 1996. Up until then, everyone had been tracking state on their own, without question. Because the web browsers failed to provide any tools beyond the purple color of a link indicating that link had been previously visited, engineers took this to mean they no longer needed to concern themselves with state at all. To the contrary, what it meant is that, from that day until this, applications engineers and designers have had to take over the full responsibility for tracking state that had historically been shared with the systems engineers, making the job that much harder.State data is neither good nor evil, but it can be put to both uses. You should make clear in your privacy policy that you will be saving data, making your case for why it is in the user\u2019s interest. Any data from the user, including state data, should be encrypted and safeguarded.", "Visible Navigation": "Most users cannot and will not build elaborate mental maps and will become lost or tired if expected to do so.The World Wide Web, for all its pretty screens and fancy buttons, is, in effect, an invisible navigation space. True, you can always see the specific page you are on, but you cannot see anything of the vast space between pages. Once users reach our sites or web-based applications, we must take care to reduce navigation to a minimum and make sure the remaining navigation is clear and natural. Ideally, present the illusion that users are always in the same place, with the work brought to them, as is done with the desktop metaphor. This not only eliminates the need for maps and other navigational aids, it offers users a greater sense of mastery and autonomy.While you may have a thousand pages on your site, if every one of them has the same heading and the same main and secondary menus, the illusion to the user will be that she is always on the same page with content changing in one panel of the page. They can still be lost if they don\u2019t know what panel they are viewing, so reinforce it by highlighting the current menu items that resulted in that particular panel, as well as offering them, in development systems that support it (and they all should), bread crumbing, such as:NN/g Home > AskTog > Interaction Design Sectionto help them build a mental model. As with the inherent statelessness of the web (see Track State, above), we must go beyond blindly accepting what the web\u2019s architects have given us by adding layers of capability and protection that users want and need. That the web\u2019s navigation is inherently invisible is a challenge, not an inevitability.In designing complex apps, strive for a minimal number of screens, each representing a separate and distinct task the user will be performing. When a user needs to perform a subtask, bring up an overlay that is smaller than full screen, so that users can see a darkened image of the main screen still present in the background. What is seen need not be memorized, so users need not remember how that overlay maps onto the screen behind it."}}, {"heading": "MUJI Philosophy", "link": "/collections/muji-philosophy", "author": "MUJI", "sourcetext": "MUJI website", "sourceurl": "http://www.muji.us/about-muji/", "detail": {"MUJI is not a brand whose value rests in the frills and \u201cextras\u201d it adds to its products.": "", "MUJI is simplicity \u2013 but a simplicity achieved through a complexity of thought and design.": "", "MUJI\u2019s streamlining is the result of the careful elimination and subtraction of gratuitous features and design unrelated to function.": "", "MUJI, the brand, is rational, and free of agenda, doctrine, and \u201cisms.\u201d The MUJI concept derives from us continuously asking, \u201cWhat is best from an individual\u2019s point of view?\u201d": "", "MUJI aspires to modesty and plainness, the better to adapt and shape itself to the styles, preferences, and practices of as wide a group of people as possible.

Creators, builders, and craftspeople throughout history have distinguished themselves as professionals by taking pride in their work. This principle is about attention-to-detail. Devoting time, energy, and love to the smallest details that are seen often or by many. It's about designing an experience that's complete and polished at every stage\u2014from pixels aligned perfectly on a grid to colors to the typography on a page of an app. Challenge yourself to feel pride in your craftsmanship at every stage of development.Get on the grid\nIn graphic design, the modern typographic grid is the scaffolding that lends coherency to your content. There are both esthetic and practical benefits to a proportional arrangement of elements. The user will be able to absorb the page quickly and comfortably.Hierarchy and balance\no make your app's visual hierarchy clear to the user, show different types of information with different properties. You can use font size, font color, positioning, and spacing to make different levels look distinct from one another. If you balance the use of these different property values in a consistent way, the user will get into the rhythm of your app and each level of hierarchy will be distinct and immediately recognizable.Who are you?\nFind the typography that best reflects your app's personality.", "Do more with less": "This principle limits your app to its core functions and no more. Think content, not chrome. Content takes many forms: pictures, emails, news articles, and so on. Remove chrome to leave only the most relevant elements on-screen, and make navigation elements from the content itself where you can. Let clean, immersive experiences rule. Every element on the screen must have value and a clear purpose.This principle doesn't mean that you should sacrifice intuition. A design is successful if navigation elements guide the user to discover how to interact with the app. Great design balances intuition with reduction and yields a clean, beautiful final product.Content, not chrome\nLet the user interact directly with content. By removing the chrome and taking advantage of font, scale, and color, content surfaces more easily. In the example, sender names and titles are easier to read.Let your content breathe\nRelevant commands and functionality are apparent and easy to understand and interact with.", "Fast and fluid": "This principle ensures that experiences are immersive and responsive. It promotes the kind of compelling animations, transitions, and responses that may not be expected, but which bring the interface to life and delight users. This principle puts people and tasks before technology.Remember that a good mobile app focuses on simple, quick-use scenarios. People use phones while they're \"on the go,\" so you need to design your app accordingly. Focus on delivering exactly what users want, with speed and focus, and you will be on your way to a great design.Be alive\nLive Tiles are responsive, alive, and engaging. Plus, they can run the gamut of your imagination\u2014from notifying you about a new email to giving you the inside tip on drink specials at your favorite bar.Motion\nCreate a sense of continuity, and let your app tell its story, through meaningful use of motion. Motion can prompt a user to initiate an action or to distinguish different types of actions. The lock screen bounces when tapped to show that you can slide it up.

Skeuomorphism looks to the rules and properties of the physical world to inform its design metaphors. But we embrace the power, language, and unique possibilities of our medium.Just as the Bauhaus design school taught the removal of superfluous design elements, this principle encourages shedding digital similes, such as leather or texture effects, stitching, shadows, and reflections. Embrace a more powerful and scalable design language. This is the foundation of the authentically digital principle.Info is in\nBe infographic, not just iconographic.

Factor your work so that apps and user scenarios on different platforms work together as one familiar experience and one brand. Users find familiarity empowering and they don't want to relearn for each surface they interact with. So build on the common platform of Microsoft software and services. Base your experiences on established and common controls, gestures, interaction patterns, animations, and even common authentication and storage cloud services.In other words, try not to reinvent the wheel. Innovation is great, but not at the expense of the user experience. Every app also conveys a certain tone of voice, a personality that resonates with users. Check out how we approach Voice and start thinking about how to use it in your app. Find what works for your app and don't hesitate to emulate what has proven effective.Think platform\nConsider how your app could work across the ecosystem of devices and form factors.

For example, an app that helps people perform a serious task can put the focus on the task by keeping decorative elements subtle and unobtrusive and by using standard controls and predictable behaviors. This app sends a clear, unified message about its purpose and its identity that helps people trust it. But if the app sends mixed signals by presenting the task in a UI that\u2019s intrusive, frivolous, or arbitrary, people might question the app\u2019s reliability or trustworthiness.On the other hand, in an app that encourages an immersive task\u2014such as a game\u2014users expect a captivating appearance that promises fun and excitement and encourages discovery.

Does it use system-provided controls, views, and icons correctly? Does it incorporate device features in ways that users expect?\nIs the app consistent within itself? Does text use uniform terminology and style? Do the same icons always mean the same thing? Can people predict what will happen when they perform the same action in different places? Do custom UI elements look and behave the same throughout the app?\nWithin reason, is the app consistent with its earlier versions? Have the terms and meanings remained the same? Are the fundamental concepts and primary functionality essentially unchanged?", "Direct Manipulation": "When people directly manipulate onscreen objects instead of using separate controls to manipulate them, they're more engaged with their task and it\u2019s easier for them to understand the results of their actions.Using the Multi-Touch interface, people can pinch to directly expand or contract an image or content area.

The best apps find the correct balance between giving people the capabilities they need while helping them avoid unwanted outcomes.Users feel more in control of an app when behaviors and controls are familiar and predictable. And when actions are simple and straightforward, users can easily understand and remember them.People expect to have ample opportunity to cancel an operation before it begins, and they expect to get a chance to confirm their intention to perform a potentially destructive action.

Your app definition statement will help you focus your app on its primary task (to learn more about this statement, see \u201cCreate an App Definition Statement\u201d). To maintain that focus, you need to determine what\u2019s most important in each context or screen.Analyze what\u2019s needed in each screen. As you decide what to display in each screen always ask yourself, Is this critical information or functionality users need right now? If your answer is no, decide whether the information or functionality might be critical in a different context, or if it\u2019s not that important after all.For example, the iPhone Calendar app is focused on days and the events that occur on them. Users can use the clearly labeled buttons to highlight the current day, select a viewing option, and add events.", "Elevate the Content that People Care About": "In a game, people care about the experience; they don\u2019t expect to manage, consume, or create content. If you\u2019re developing a game, you elevate content by enhancing the experience with a satisfying story, beautiful graphics, and responsive gameplay.If you\u2019re not developing a game, you can help people focus on the content by designing your UI as a subtle frame for the information they\u2019re interested in. Here are some ways you can do this:Minimize the number and prominence of controls to decrease their weight in the UI. Photos does this by placing a few unobtrusive controls on translucent bars.Consider subtly customizing controls so that they integrate with your app\u2019s graphical style. In this way, controls are discoverable and comprehensible, without being conspicuous.Consider fading controls after people have stopped interacting with them for a little while, and redisplaying them when people tap the screen. Sometimes you may want to fade the rest of your app UI, too. This is especially appropriate in apps that enable an immersive experience, because it gives even more of the screen space to the content people want to see. For example, Photos fades the controls and bars after a few moments of noninteraction, which encourages people to immerse themselves in the content. When people want to perform a task with their photos, a single tap anywhere on the screen redisplays the controls. ", "Think Top Down": "The top of the screen is most visible to people, because they tend to interact with the device by holding the device in the following ways:Put the most frequently used (usually higher level) information near the top, where it is most visible and easy to reach. As the user scans the screen from top to bottom, the information displayed should progress from general to specific and from high level to low level.In a game, for example, the most important action can take place in the top half of the screen. This leaves the bottom half of the screen for supplementary information and for controls users can tap without obscuring their view.", "Give People a Logical Path to Follow": "People appreciate knowing where they are in an app and getting confirmation that they\u2019re on the right path.Make the path through the information you present logical and easy for users to predict. In addition, be sure to provide markers\u2014such as back buttons\u2014that users can use to find out where they are and how to retrace their steps.In most cases, give users only one path to a screen. If a screen needs to be accessible in different circumstances, consider using a modal view that can appear in different contexts.", "Make Usage Easy and Obvious": "Strive to make your app instantly understandable to people, because you can\u2019t assume that they have the time\u2014or can spare the attention\u2014to figure out how it works.Make the main function of your app immediately apparent. You can make it so by:Be consistent with the usage paradigms of the built-in apps. Users understand how to navigate a hierarchy of screens, edit list contents, and switch among app modes using the tab bar. Make it easy for people to use your app by reinforcing their experience. For example, people understand that the blue button in a toolbar represents the action they\u2019re most likely to take in the current context. If your app displays more than one blue button in a single context, users will have to figure out which one to tap.In the built-in Stopwatch function (part of the iPhone Clock app) users can see at a glance which button stops and starts the stopwatch and which button captures lap times.", "Use User-Centric Terminology": "In all your text-based communication with users, use terminology you\u2019re sure they understand. Use what you know about your users to determine whether the words and phrases you plan to use are appropriate. For example, technical jargon is rarely helpful in an app aimed at unsophisticated users, but in an app designed for technically savvy users, it might be appreciated.The Wi-Fi Networks Settings screen uses plain language to explain how iOS responds to the user\u2019s preference.Take care to be accurate when describing dates. It\u2019s often appropriate to use friendly terms such as \u201ctoday\u201d and \u201ctomorrow\u201d when you display date information in your UI, but it can be confusing if you don\u2019t account for the user\u2019s current locale. For example, consider an event that starts just before midnight. To users in the same time zone, the event starts today, but to users in an earlier time zone, the same event may have started yesterday.", "Minimize the Effort Required for User Input": "Inputting information takes time and attention, whether people tap controls or use the keyboard. If your app requires a lot of user input before anything useful happens, that input slows people down and can discourage them from using your app.Balance a request for user input with what you offer users in return. In other words, strive to provide as much information or functionality as possible for each piece of information people give you. That way, people feel they are making progress and are not being delayed as they move through your app.Make it easy for users to make choices. For example, you can use a table view or a picker instead of a text field, because it\u2019s usually easier for people to select an item from a list than to type words. Get information from iOS, when appropriate. People store lots of information on their devices. When it makes sense, don\u2019t force people to give you information you can easily find for yourself, such as their contacts or calendar information.", "Downplay File-Handling Operations": "Although iOS apps can allow people to create and manipulate files, this does not mean that people should have an awareness of a file system on an iOS device.There is no iOS app analogous to the OS X Finder, and people shouldn\u2019t be asked to interact with files as they do on a computer. In particular, people shouldn\u2019t be faced with anything that encourages them to think about file metadata or locations, such as:As much as possible, allow people to manage documents without opening iTunes on their computer. Consider using iCloud to help users access their content on all of their devices.If your app allows people to create and edit documents, it\u2019s appropriate to provide some sort of document picker that allows them to open an existing document or create a new one. Ideally, such a document picker:You can also use the Quick Look Preview feature to allow people to preview documents within your app, even if your app can\u2019t open them. ", "Enable Collaboration and Connectedness": "iOS devices are personal devices, but they also encourage collaboration and sharing with others. Enhance your app by helping people collaborate and connect with others.When appropriate, make it easy for people to interact with others and share things like their location, opinions, and high scores. People generally expect to be able to share information that\u2019s important to them.Most apps can add value by allowing people to go beyond the app and share data with other tools they use. For example, an iOS app can act as a mobile complement to a computer app. Or, an iPad app might allow its users to communicate with the users of the iPhone version of the app.If your app allows people to access their social media accounts, be sure to take advantage of the Social framework APIs so that you can avoid asking users to sign in multiple times on the same device.For iPad, think of ways to allow more than one person to use your app on the same device. For example, two people might be able to play a game on opposing sides of an onscreen board. Or a band app might allow different people to play different instruments together on a single device.", "De-emphasize Settings": "Avoid including settings in your app if you can. Settings include preferred app behaviors and information that people rarely want to change. Users can\u2019t open the Settings app without first switching away from your app, and you don\u2019t want to encourage this action.When you design your app to function the way most of your users expect, you decrease the need for settings. If you need information about the user, query the system for it instead of asking users to provide it. Let users set the behavior they want by using configuration options in your app. Configuration options let your app react dynamically to changes, because people don\u2019t have to leave your app to set them.Offer configuration options in the main UI or\u2014in iPhone apps\u2014on the back of a view. To decide which location makes sense, determine whether the options represent a primary task and how often people might want to set them.In the main UI, put options that provide primary functionality or that people want to change frequently.For example, iPad Calendar allows people to view their schedules by day, week, or month. These configuration options are offered in the main UI because viewing different perspectives of a calendar is a primary function of the app and people are likely to change their focus frequently.Apps that provide an immersive experience, such as games, are most likely to provide configuration options within the app, because users tend to change aspects of the experience frequently.In iPhone apps, you can put options that people don\u2019t need to change frequently on the back of a view. For example, the primary function of Weather is to display a city\u2019s current conditions and 6-day forecast. Although it\u2019s important to be able to choose whether temperatures are displayed in Celsius or Fahrenheit, people aren\u2019t likely to change this option very often. Therefore it makes sense to put the temperature-scale option on the back of the Weather view, where it\u2019s conveniently available, but not obtrusive.", "Brand Appropriately": "Incorporate a brand\u2019s colors or images in a refined, unobtrusive way. Branding is most effective when it\u2019s subtle and understated. People use your app to get things done or to be entertained; they don\u2019t want to feel as if they\u2019re being forced to watch an advertisement. For the best user experience, you want to quietly remind users of your identity.Avoid taking space away from the content people care about. For example, displaying a second, persistent bar at the top of the screen that does nothing but display branding assets means that there\u2019s less room for content. Consider other, less intrusive ways to display pervasive branding, such as subtly customizing the background of a screen.Important: The exception to these guidelines is your app icon, which should be completely focused on your brand. Because users see your app icon frequently, it\u2019s important to spend time designing an icon that balances eye-appeal with brand recognition.", "Make Search Quick and Rewarding": "In apps that handle or display a lot of data, search can be a primary function. If you need to provide search in your app, follow these guidelines to ensure that it performs well.Build indexes of your data so that you are always prepared for search. Don't wait until the user initiates a search to do this, because you can't afford to create a negative first impression of the search experience in your app.Live-filter local data so that you can display results more quickly. It\u2019s best when you can begin filtering as soon as users begin typing, and narrow the results as they continue typing. Although live-filtering data usually produces a superior user experience, it\u2019s not always practical. When live filtering is impractical, you can begin the search process after the user taps the Search button in the keyboard. If you do this, be sure to provide feedback on the search\u2019s progress so users know that the process has not stalled.When possible, also filter remote data while users type. Although filtering users\u2019 typing can result in a better search experience, be sure to inform them and give them an opportunity to opt out if the response time is likely to delay the results by more than a second or two.Display a search bar above a list or the index in a list. Users expect to find a search bar in this position, because they're accustomed to the search bar in Contacts and other apps. Putting the search bar in this location means that it stays out of users\u2019 way when they're scrolling through the list or using the index, but is conveniently available when it's needed.Use a tab for search only in special circumstances. If search is a primary function in your app you might want to feature it as a distinct mode. In iTunes, for example, finding and getting music and podcasts is the focus of the app. Users want to search for their favorite songs, artists, or podcasts regardless of the mode they're currently in, so it makes sense to offer a dedicated search tab that's always available.If necessary, display placeholder content right away and partial results as they become available. In this way, you give users useful information promptly. In iTunes, for example, users initiate a search for content by tapping the Search button. If the network connection is slow, iTunes first displays the Loading... message along with a spinning activity indicator so users know that search is proceeding. iTunes then displays a results view in which each section is populated with textual results\u2014such as title and genre\u2014and a custom outline of a box. As users scan the items in each section, thumbnail images appear in the box outlines.Consider providing a scope bar if the data sorts naturally into different categories. A scope bar allows users to specify locations or rules in a search or to filter objects by specific criteria. It contains up to four scope buttons, each representing a category. For example, Mail provides a scope bar that allows users to focus their search on the From, To, or Subject fields of messages, or broaden the search to include all fields. Providing a scope bar helps users focus their search and can significantly reduce the number of results. ", "Entice and Inform with a Well-Written Description": "Your App Store description is a great opportunity to communicate with potential users. In addition to describing your app accurately and highlighting the qualities you think people might appreciate the most, follow these guidelines:Be sure to correct all spelling, grammatical, and punctuation errors. Although such errors don\u2019t bother everyone, in some people they can create a negative impression of your app\u2019s quality.Keep all-capital words to a minimum. The occasional all-capital word can draw people\u2019s attention, but capitalizing every letter of every word in a description can make it very difficult to read.Consider describing specific bug fixes. If a new version of your app contains bug fixes that customers have been waiting for, it can be a good idea to mention this in your description.", "Be Succinct": "Think like a newspaper editor, and strive to convey information in a condensed, headline style. When your UI text is short and direct, users can absorb it quickly and easily. Identify the most important information, express it concisely, and display it prominently so that people don\u2019t have to read too many words to find what they\u2019re looking for or to figure out what to do next. Give controls short labels, or use well-understood symbols, so that people can tell what they do at a glance. When appropriate, use the built-in buttons and icons described in \u201cSystem-Provided Buttons and Icons\u201d for guidelines on designing your own icons, see \u201cIcons for Navigation Bars, Toolbars, and Tab Bars.\u201d", "Use UI Elements Consistently": "People expect standard views and controls to look and behave consistently across apps. Follow the recommended usages for standard user interface elements. In this way, users can depend on their prior experience to help them as they learn to use your app. You also make it easy for your app to look up-to-date and work correctly if iOS changes the look or behavior of these standard views or controls.For an app that enables an immersive task\u2014such as a game\u2014it\u2019s reasonable to create completely custom controls. This is because you\u2019re creating a unique environment, and discovering how to control that environment is an experience users expect in such apps. Avoid radically changing the appearance of a control that performs a standard action. If you use unfamiliar controls to perform standard actions, users will spend time discovering how to use them and will wonder what, if anything, your controls do that the standard ones do not.iOS makes available to you many of the standard buttons and icons used throughout the built-in apps. For example, you can use the same Refresh, Organize, Trash, Reply, and Compose icons that Mail uses on both iPhone and iPad.To avoid confusing people, never use the standard buttons and icons to mean something else. Be sure you understand the documented meaning of a standard button or icon; don\u2019t rely on your interpretation of its appearance. To learn more about using system-provided items, see \u201cSystem-Provided Buttons and Icons.\u201dIn addition to the benefit of leveraging users\u2019 prior experience, using system-provided buttons and icons imparts two other substantial advantages:Decreased development time, because you don\u2019t have to create custom art to represent standard functions.Increased stability of your user interface, even if future iOS updates change the appearances of standard icons. In other words, you can rely on the semantic meaning of a standard icon remaining the same, even if its appearance changes.The Interface Builder editor in Xcode makes it easy to use the system-provided buttons and apply system-provided icons to your controls. For guidance, see the appearance-related information in \u201cEdit User Interfaces\u201d in Interface Builder User Guide.If you can\u2019t find a system-provided button or icon that has the appropriate meaning for a specific function in your app, you should design a custom button or icon. For some guidelines to help you do this, see \u201cIcons for Navigation Bars, Toolbars, and Tab Bars.\u201d", "Consider Adding Physicality and Realism": "When appropriate, add a realistic, physical dimension to your app. Sometimes, the more true to life your app looks and behaves, the easier it is for people to understand how it works and the more they enjoy using it. For example, people instantly know how to use the realistic address book that Contacts on iPad portrays.On iPhone, people instantly know what the Voice Memos app does, and how to use it, because it presents a beautifully rendered focal image (the microphone) and realistic controls.Think of the objects and scenes you design as opportunities to communicate with users and to express the essence of your app. Don\u2019t feel that you must strive for scrupulous accuracy. Often, an amplified or enhanced portrayal of something can seem more real, and convey more meaning, than a faithful likeness.Use appropriate animation to further enhance realism in your app. In general, it\u2019s more important to strive for accuracy in movement than in appearance. This is because people accept artistic license in appearance, but they can feel disoriented when they see movement that appears to defy physical laws. As much as possible, make sure your virtual views and controls mimic the behavior of the physical objects and controls they resemble. Convincing animation heightens people\u2019s impression of your app as a tangible, physical realm in which they want to spend time.", "Delight People with Stunning Graphics": "Rich, beautiful, engaging graphics draw people into an app and make the simplest task rewarding. Beautiful artwork also helps to build your app\u2019s brand in people\u2019s eyes. iOS devices showcase your app\u2019s artwork, so you should consider hiring a professional artist to create first-rate graphics that people will admire.Consider replicating the look of high-quality or precious materials. If the effect of wood, leather, or metal is appropriate in your app, take the time to make sure the material looks realistic and valuable. For example, Notes reproduces the look of fine leather and meticulous stitching.Create high-resolution artwork. In most cases, scaling up your artwork is not recommended as a long-term solution. Instead, try creating your artwork in a dimension that is larger than you need, so you can add depth and details before scaling it down. This works especially well when the dimension of the original art file is a multiple of the dimension you need. Then, if you also use an appropriate grid size in your image-editing app, you\u2019ll be able to keep the scaled-down art file crisp and reduce the amount of retouching and sharpening you need to do.Spend the time to design a beautiful, memorable app icon. It\u2019s not unusual for users to base the decision to download an app on the quality of its app icon. For guidelines on how to create an app icon, see \u201cApp Icons.\u201dRemove hard-coded values that identify screen dimensions. This is particularly important if you want your app to run on different iOS devices or external displays."}}, {"heading": "IBM Design Principles", "link": "/collections/ibm-design-principles", "author": "IBM Design", "sourcetext": "IBM Design", "sourceurl": "https://www-01.ibm.com/software/ucd/designconcepts/designbasics.html", "detail": {"Concepts from the product's subject domain (for example, systems management) should be central and apparent in the software design.": "The relationships among user interface objects in products should be accurate, so that users can rely on their previous experience in the domain when learning and using the software.", "Keep it simple.": "Give easy access to the features that most users will need most of the time; features used less often or by only a subset of users are placed less prominently.", "Optimize the design for the most frequent or important tasks.": "Understanding how users will use the software you are designing is critically important. Designers should use that understanding to anticipate the information, task flows, and features that users require at key points within the user experience.", "Make the interface accessible and visible to users.": "Design your Web site or application so that users can view and easily access objects or information within the interface.

An important object can be given visual prominence. Relative position and contrast in color and size can be used to convey task importance.Affordance: When users can easily determine the action that should be taken with an object, that object displays good affordance. Objects with good affordance usually mimic actual objects.Visual scheme: Design a visual scheme that maps to the user model and lets the user customize the interface.

Hundreds of thousands of advertisers worldwide use AdWords to promote their products; hundreds of thousands of publishers take advantage of our AdSense programme to deliver ads relevant to their site content. To ensure that we\u2019re ultimately serving all our users (whether they are advertisers or not), we have a set of guiding principles for our advertising programmes and practices:We don\u2019t allow ads to be displayed on our results pages unless they are relevant where they are shown. And we firmly believe that ads can provide useful information if, and only if, they are relevant to what you wish to find \u2013 so it\u2019s possible that certain searches won\u2019t lead to any ads at all.We believe that advertising can be effective without being flashy. We don\u2019t accept pop\u2013up advertising, which interferes with your ability to see the content that you\u2019ve requested. We\u2019ve found that text ads that are relevant to the person reading them draw much higher click-through rates than ads appearing randomly. Any advertiser, whether small or large, can take advantage of this highly targeted medium.Advertising on Google is always clearly identified as a \u201cSponsored Link\u201d, so it does not compromise the integrity of our search results. We never manipulate rankings to put our partners higher in our search results and no-one can buy better PageRank.

Sometimes it was just a matter of integrating new databases into search, such as adding a phone number and address look-up and a business directory. Other efforts required a bit more creativity, like adding the ability to search news archives, patents, academic journals, billions of images and millions of books.

To that end, we have offices in more than 60 countries, maintain more than 180 Internet domains and serve more than half of our results to people living outside the United States. We offer Google\u2019s search interface in more than 130 languages, offer people the ability to restrict results to content written in their own language and aim to provide the rest of our applications and products in as many languages and accessible formats as possible. Using our translation tools, people can discover content written on the other side of the world in languages that they don\u2019t speak. With these tools and the help of volunteer translators, we have been able to greatly improve both the variety and quality of services that we can offer in even the most far\u2013flung corners of the globe.", "You can be serious without a suit": "Our founders built Google around the idea that work should be challenging and that the challenge should be fun. We believe that great, creative things are more likely to happen with the right company culture \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t just mean lava lamps and rubber balls. There is an emphasis on team achievements and pride in individual accomplishments that contribute to our overall success. We put great stock in our employees \u2013 energetic, passionate people from diverse backgrounds, with creative approaches to work, play and life. Our atmosphere may be casual, but as new ideas emerge in a caf\u00e9 line, at a team meeting or at the gym, they are traded, tested and put into practice with dizzying speed \u2013 and they may be the launch pad for a new project destined for worldwide use.", "Great just isn\u2019t good enough": "We see being great at something as a starting point, not an end point. We set ourselves goals that we know we can\u2019t reach yet, because we know that by stretching to meet them, we can get further than we expected. Through innovation and iteration, we aim to take things that work well and improve upon them in unexpected ways. For example, when one of our engineers saw that search worked well for properly spelt words, he wondered about how it handled typos. That led him to create an intuitive and more helpful spell checker.Even if you don\u2019t know exactly what you\u2019re looking for, finding an answer on the web is our problem, not yours. We try to anticipate needs not yet articulated by our global audience and meet them with products and services that set new standards. When we launched Gmail, it had more storage space than any email service available. In retrospect, offering that seems obvious \u2013 but that\u2019s because now we have new standards for email storage. Those are the kinds of changes that we seek to make and we\u2019re always looking for new places where we can make a difference.

That will make them feel lighter and likely a lot happier.", "Acknowledge that the user is not like you": "What\u2019s obvious to you isn\u2019t necessarily obvious to someone else. Our thought processes and understanding of the world around us are deeply affected by our genetics, upbringing, religious and geographical culture, and past experiences. There is a very small likelihood that the people you are designing for have all the distinctive qualities that make you you. Don\u2019t assume you innately understand the needs of your customers. How many people do you think truly understand what it feels like to be you?", "Have empathy": "Empathy is the ability to understand and share another person\u2019s perspective and feelings. Step outside your box and try really hard to understand the world from another person\u2019s point of view. Go out of your way to identify with their needs. If certain things just don\u2019t make sense to you, ask more questions. Ask as many questions as you need to until you finally understand.

Touchscreens and gestural interaction functionality enable users to feel as if they are physically touching and manipulating information with their fingertips. Instead of what you see is what you get (WYSIWIG), successful NUI interfaces embody the principle of what you do is what you get.", "Principle of Scaffolding": "Successful natural user interfaces feel intuitive and joyful to use. Information objects in a NUI behave in a manner that users intuitively expect. Unlike a successful GUI in which many options and commands are presented all at once and are depicted with very subtle hierarchy and visual emphasis, a successful NUI contains fewer options with interaction scaffolding.

Instead of getting lost in a labyrinth of menu options, menus on NUIs are streamlined, enabling more opportunities for users to engage and interact with other users instead of the system\u2019s interface. As opposed to GUI laptops, which are optimized for individual use, systems with larger NUI formats, like the Microsoft Surface Table or tablets similar to the iPad, lend themselves to social computing experiences.", "Principle of Spatial Relationships": "Unlike GUI systems, where an icon serves as visual representation of information, NUIs represent information as objects. In the world of successful natural user interfaces, a portion of an object often stands for the object itself. NUI objects are intelligent and have auras.", "Principle of Seamlessness": "GUIs require a keyboard and mouse for interaction with computing systems. Touchscreens, sensors embedded in hardware, and the use of gestural UIs enable NUI interactions to feel seamless for users because the interactions are direct.
